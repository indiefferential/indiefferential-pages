Social media posts frequently go viral questioning why these specific tracks keep appearing, even after listening to vastly different genres. For example, one user noted that Carpenter's Please Please Please followed the distinctly different Get It Sexy by St. Louis rapper Sexyy Red, while another observed Espresso frequently playing after listening to "sad music and songwriter types."</p><p> </p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><div style="position: relative; width: 400px; height: 250px;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; border: none; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0; top: 0;" src="https://online.fliphtml5.com/kemkr/ctah/" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div></div></div><p><br><br>This trend has led some fans to speculate wildly, even suggesting outlandish ideas like a "mass autoplay feature" activated by certain artists—a feature that doesn't actually exist. Some have accused artists like Roan of being "industry plants," a term often used to discredit musicians who quickly gain popularity. Others have revived the term "payola," speculating that labels might be paying to have their artists' songs prioritized in Spotify's algorithm.</p><p>There's a notable difference between what feels popular and what is statistically popular, which adds to the confusion among fans. For example, despite extensive media coverage, Beyoncé’s <em>Cowboy Carter</em> is only at No. 16 on the UK’s Official Charts Company's list of top-selling albums for 2024, lagging behind releases from Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, and multiple albums from Taylor Swift. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jul/29/the-music-industry-is-engineering-artist-popularity-and-listeners-are-right-to-be-angry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a></p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/Mp3c39j/whats-new-17.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="whats-new-17" border="0"></p><p>Adding to the controversy is Spotify's "discovery mode," a feature launched in 2020 that allows artists to give up a portion of their royalties in exchange for increased visibility in algorithm-driven features like autoplay, radio, and mixes. While not traditional payola, this feature does feel similar to users, sparking concerns about the fairness and transparency of music discovery on the platform.</p><p>Despite Spotify's claims that discovery mode leads to significant increases in user engagement, the actual financial benefits for artists remain unclear. The music industry has not been forthcoming about this feature, leading to fan concerns that the platform may be manipulating their listening experience. There's also fear within the industry that criticizing Spotify could result in reduced support, despite no concrete evidence of such repercussions.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on July 31, 2024</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" alt="Indiefferential"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="inverse" title="Indiefferential">Indiefferential</a></h3>Indiefferential team<p><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/a-conversation-with-megan-conner/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/356/responsive/whats-new-16-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">A conversation with Megan Conner</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/introducing-jessemelancholy-adelaides-genre-defying-talent/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">Introducing JesseMelancholy: Adelaide&#x27;s Genre-Defying Talent</h3></div><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/361/responsive/whats-new-21-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/spotify-seeks-court-dismissal-of-mlc-lawsuit-over-songwriter-pay-cuts/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/373/responsive/pexels-photo-218686-xs.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="540" width="960" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/spotify-seeks-court-dismissal-of-mlc-lawsuit-over-songwriter-pay-cuts/" class="inverse">Spotify Seeks Court Dismissal of MLC Lawsuit Over Songwriter Pay Cuts</a></h4><time datetime="2024-11-11T00:17">November 11, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/the-hidden-ai-scams-on-spotify-fake-bands-real-money/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/367/responsive/whats-new-24-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/the-hidden-ai-scams-on-spotify-fake-bands-real-money/" class="inverse">The Hidden AI Scams on Spotify: Fake Bands, Real Money</a></h4><time datetime="2024-08-25T20:11">August 25, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/indiefferential"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7Gwd5X8/indiefferential-members.png" alt="indiefferential-members" border="0"></a></div></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/">Indiefferential</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Indiefferential 2025</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://indiefferential.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
