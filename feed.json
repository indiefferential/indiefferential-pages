Not through a lack of opportunity, but through an endless deluge of content intended to distract, dilute, and disconnect writers from their own voice.<br><br>Here are the accounts that artists should seriously contemplate unfollowing in 2026.<br><br><strong>1. Hustle Influencers Monetizing on Anxiety</strong><br><br>\"If the underlying message of an account is ’you’re already behind,’ then it's not motivation, it's manipulation.\"<br><br>It’s a group of people who promote productivity tips, algorithm panic, and faux urgency in order to sell courses, templates, or secrets that often have nothing to do with making artists grow creatively. Artists aren’t asked to share more content, work harder, or maximize every moment. They require clarity, patience, and time to innovate.<br><br>If following someone makes you feel guilty for resting and creating slowly, unfollow.<br><br><strong>2. Brands that Cosplay as Community</strong><br><br>In the year 2026, brands are louder than ever, but authenticity is thinner.<br><br>In many brand accounts, there is regurgitated activist speak, trend riding on cultural phenomena, and feigning interest in “supporting artists” while supplying nothing but exposure and platitudes in return. A brand that has never paid an artist, amplified actual artistic work, and has never made a meaningful commitment is not part of any sort of community; it is only marketing.<br><br>Artists need to stop following the brands that draw upon the culture without contributing to said culture in return.<br><br><strong>3. AI Slop Accounts</strong><br><br>The problem isn’t AI-written content, it’s lazy AI content.<br><br>The kinds of accounts that are churning out &amp;quot;mass-produced thought of the day&amp;quot;-type quotes, knockoff art, simulated faces, or generic notions of &amp;quot;creative inspiration&amp;quot; in the form of generated text prompts rather than personal experience are flooding the feeds.<br><br>\"If an account rings hollow, or seems to be repeating itself, or lacks emotional resonance, trust your gut.\" Inspiration should be human.<br><br><strong>4. Comparison Traps Disguised as Advice</strong><br><br>Rather, some boasting narratives claim to educate but are filled with victories and accomplishments.<br><br>When every single post is about streams, followers, sold-out shows, or “how fast I grew,” it silently equates artistic expression with a scorecard. Artists come to determine their own worth based on another person’s timeline.<br><br>Growth doesn’t require an audience. Art doesn’t require proof.<br><br><strong>5. Trend-First, Soul-Last Creators</strong><br><br>Awareness of trends is good. Dependence on trends is fatal. Accounts that pursue every sound, every aesthetic, or every shift in platforms urge the artist to trade their identity for relevance. By 2026, the public hungers for voice, not speed. It’s the artists who no longer shape-shift that will endure. “Because if an explanation confuses you instead of clarifying your gut, let the explanation go.”</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>There was a point when buying a guitar was a straightforward affair. You entered a store, lugged home a piece of wood, disputed with the sales assistant over whether a certain model had or hadn’t piqued the interest of a certain Eric Clapton, and went home poor but cheerful. But in 2026, the guitar market—much like the world of modern transportation—finds itself congested and besotted with the keys to innovation and thronged with offerings of which very few will own a genuine need—while the really important stuff improves quietly behind the scenes.<br><br>First of all, I'd like to talk about what's worth spending money on, what's absolutely not, and how to avoid ending up with a piece of wood that might look great on Instagram, but plays like a kitchen table.</p>\n<p><strong>The Golden Age of “Cheap but Good”</strong><br><br>This is the unpleasant reality for guitar snobs: guitars for value in 2026 are ridiculously good. It’s now so player-friendly it’s almost embarrassing if you have to look at a receipt from 1997 with three thousand bucks going into a guitar.<br><br>Such brands as Squier, Epiphone, Yamaha, Harley Benton, and Cort are rolling out guitars with good fret jobs, stable necks, adequate pickup systems, and — ready for this?— setups that won’t immediately require the services of a man named Dave and his trusty soldering iron. Today, a Squier Classic Vibe Stratocaster plays so well that a consumer may be left scratching his head and wondering what the point of a \"real\" Fender is, if the only pleasure to be derived from the experience of playing a \"real\" Fender is arguing with fanboys on the net.<br><br>Harley Benton, on the other hand, is continuing its tradition of corporate sabotage with locking tuners, roasted maple neck, and stainless steel frets for the price of a decent Chinese. Glamorous? Not exactly. But annoyingly effective? Yes.<br><br>The point here is simple: if you are spending money between £300 and £600 in 2026 and buying a reputable brand, then you are not settling, you are winning.<br><br><strong>The Mid-Range Sweet Spot Nobody Talks About</strong></p>\n<p><br>Finding a golf swing<br><br>Now things become more intriguing, and most level-headed folk would cease their commentary at this point. The £700-£1,200 price range in 2026 is analogous to the golden age of hot hatchbacks. It’s a period during which one gets speedy performance with little compromise and absolutely minimal buyer’s remorse.<br><br>\"The PRS SE models are the poster children of this situation. They're pricey-looking guitars, easy to play, and they sound good enough to let you forget that the headstock doesn’t read ‘Custom Shop.’ The SE Custom 24 is one of the most irritatingly sensible guitars ever produced.\"</p>\n<p>Then there’s Yamaha’s Revstar range: another triumph for understated excellence. None of this hype, just solid, beautifully crafted guitars with an air about them as if they’ve been designed by grown-ups who play the things. They are the equivalent of the Volvo estate car: rough-looking until you play one, then you just can’t get enough.<br><br>This is also where you should be looking if resale value is a concern to you. Good, recognizable lines from Fender, Gibson's Studio series, PRS SE, and Ibanez Prestige will remain worth something even if, inevitably, you find yourself saying, “Oh, I'm more of a Tele man, myself.\"<br><br>The High-End Illusion<br><br>Above £2,000, guitars become less about improvement and more about justification. Ah, yes, they're beautiful. Ah, yes, the scent of the nitrocellulose lacquer is a hint of history tinged with regret. But the law of diminishing returns bites harder than a dropped Les Paul.<br><br>A £4,000 guitar in 2026 will not be four times as good as a £1,000 one. It will be slightly better, perhaps prettier, but certainly much more stressful to possess. You'll worry about scratches. You'll have fights over cases. You'll not take it to pubs with sticky floors.<br><br>If it’s what pleases you, buy it. Happiness is a key part of this. Just don’t pretend it’s “better value.” It isn’t.<br><br>The Tech Nobody Asked For (But You’ll Get Anyway)<br><br>Guitar tech in 2026? Like lane-departure systems in a car: occasionally genius, mostly pesky, and mostly unnecessary. Integrated effects, app-managed tone control, Ai-aided pick-up changes? All cool, all gonna be disabled in a week.<br><br>Modeling guitars have not gone away, they're still making the demos sound amazing, but the truth is the market has quietly decided it really wants one killer sound rather than a thousand decent ones. The truth is, the real innovations in technology have been very, very boring: just better tuners, lighter hardware, more stable necks, and pickups that don’t make the sound of an angry refrigerator.<br><br>This is progress. Boring, glorious progress.<br><br>What Should You Actually Buy?<br><br>Buy the guitar that excites you to play. Not the one that YouTube recommended you to buy. Not the one with the most number of switches. Not the one that resembles a design made by a gaming laptop. In 2026, value for money will be good build quality, logical electronics, decent ergonomics, and a brand which will be around in ten years’ time. Spend as much money as you can, but don’t buy the level above ‘luxury,’ and remember this: tone lives in your fingers, not on price. \"And if anyone tries to give you different information, you smile and wave and then go and enjoy your perfectly excellent and moderately-priced instrument – preferably while playing it very loudly.\"</p>",

There has been an algorithm-chasing, fast release, and visually overwhelming paradigm, but there’s been an evident pivot to slower tempos, emotional specificity, and emphasis on intent and purpose. There’s no real thread running through these amazing indie releases other than one that revolves around “presence,” which involves lived-in, thoughtful, and unafraid-to-be songs.<br><br>\"Discovery is gradually taking place at this intersection: Where polish and authenticity come together, and artists straddle the traditional industry push and still come off as totally confident. Sites like Musosoup have become valuable trendspotters, not in what they think is hip, but in what happens. And what happens is a clear identification of an indie scene that favors vulnerable and artful over big and boisterous.\" </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 data-start=\"1747\" data-end=\"1789\"><strong data-start=\"1750\" data-end=\"1789\">Artists Shaping Indie Music in 2026</strong></h2>\n<h3 data-start=\"1791\" data-end=\"1873\"><strong data-start=\"1795\" data-end=\"1873\">Plastic Orchestra — Melbourne, Australia | Alt-Indie / Experimental Groove</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"1875\" data-end=\"2356\">Plastic Orchestra’s <em data-start=\"1895\" data-end=\"1916\">“Crick in the Neck”</em> is a study in restraint—proof that softness can still groove. Slowing things down without losing momentum, the Melbourne collective delivers a song that feels quietly radical in its empathy. Built around 70s-inspired experimental guitar textures, R&amp;B-inflected rhythms, and gently chanting vocal harmonies, the track honours the emotional labourers of everyday life—the people who hold others together while slowly wearing themselves thin.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2358\" data-end=\"2778\">What makes Plastic Orchestra emblematic of 2026’s indie shift is their refusal to dramatise vulnerability. Instead, they let it breathe. Led by bassist Grace Snow, the project feels less like a band and more like a shared laboratory of sound—an intentional embrace of play, texture, and communal creativity. In an era where indie increasingly values feel over force, Plastic Orchestra’s music lingers long after it ends.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"2780\" data-end=\"2783\">\n<h3 data-start=\"2785\" data-end=\"2857\"><strong data-start=\"2789\" data-end=\"2857\">Powers of the Monk — Michigan, USA | Dream-Indie / Ambient Psych</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"2859\" data-end=\"3256\">There’s a liminal quality to <em data-start=\"2888\" data-end=\"2905\">“Sleepy Fields”</em> that feels perfectly timed for 2026. Powers of the Monk operate in the space between waking and dreaming, where songs don’t demand attention but quietly envelop it. Reforming in 2020, the Michigan-based duo craft music that feels meditative without drifting into abstraction—anchored by gentle rhythms, warm instrumentation, and a sense of deep calm.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3258\" data-end=\"3611\"><em data-start=\"3258\" data-end=\"3275\">“Sleepy Fields”</em> unfolds like an invitation rather than an escape, positioning rest itself as something intentional and luminous. In a cultural moment increasingly concerned with mental health, burnout, and sustainability, Powers of the Monk reflect a broader indie movement toward music as a grounding force—sound as sanctuary rather than stimulation.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"3613\" data-end=\"3616\">\n<h3 data-start=\"3618\" data-end=\"3667\"><strong data-start=\"3622\" data-end=\"3667\">VERONICA — London, UK | Pop / Jazz Fusion</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"3669\" data-end=\"3997\">With <em data-start=\"3674\" data-end=\"3692\">“Ground To Dust”</em>, VERONICA exemplifies a growing class of indie artists blurring genre lines not for novelty, but for emotional precision. Recorded at London’s Meridian Studios, the track merges pop’s structural clarity with the harmonic richness of jazz, resulting in a ballad that feels both intimate and sophisticated.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3999\" data-end=\"4474\">Born in Italy and now based in London, VERONICA’s background in classical piano and songwriting education at BIMM London surfaces subtly—not as virtuosity on display, but as control. Her sultry, nuanced vocals carry themes of dependence and vulnerability with restraint, allowing the emotional weight to unfold naturally. As indie music in 2026 leans increasingly toward nuanced storytelling, VERONICA’s work feels quietly assured, signalling longevity rather than immediacy.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"4476\" data-end=\"4479\">\n<h3 data-start=\"4481\" data-end=\"4541\"><strong data-start=\"4485\" data-end=\"4541\">Stephanie Happening — Experimental / Performance Art</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"4543\" data-end=\"4906\"><em data-start=\"4543\" data-end=\"4564\">“Breathing Bruised”</em> resists easy categorisation—and that’s precisely the point. Framed as a “Solstice testimony,” the track functions less as a traditional song and more as a document of survival. Part of Stephanie Happening’s ongoing <em data-start=\"4780\" data-end=\"4794\">System Talks</em> series, it exists at the intersection of experimental sound, mental health advocacy, and collective authorship.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4908\" data-end=\"5320\">Rather than offering resolution, <em data-start=\"4941\" data-end=\"4962\">“Breathing Bruised”</em> prioritises presence. Its rhythmic pulse feels deliberate, almost ritualistic, transforming lived experience into sound without sanitising it. In 2026, indie music’s boundaries continue to expand beyond entertainment alone, and Stephanie Happening stands as a powerful example of how music can function as process, protest, and healing space simultaneously.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"5322\" data-end=\"5325\">\n<h3 data-start=\"5327\" data-end=\"5403\"><strong data-start=\"5331\" data-end=\"5403\">Deciderata — Philadelphia, USA | Tru-Fusion / Alternative Collective</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"5405\" data-end=\"5845\">Deciderata’s <em data-start=\"5418\" data-end=\"5435\">“Reflections:1”</em> isn’t a comeback album—it’s a recontextualisation. Reuniting after a period of inactivity, the Philadelphia collective revisits earlier material through the lens of experience, breathing new life into songs by filtering them through their distinctive Tru-Fusion ethos. Drawing from funk, screamo, nu-metal, gospel, jazz, reggae, and rock, the album feels cohesive not despite its diversity, but because of it.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5847\" data-end=\"6188\">Led by Chris Morano’s meticulous production vision, <em data-start=\"5899\" data-end=\"5916\">“Reflections:1”</em> speaks to a wider 2026 indie trend: artists reassessing their own archives with renewed clarity. Rather than chasing novelty, Deciderata embrace evolution—demonstrating that indie credibility increasingly comes from continuity, collaboration, and creative self-awareness.</p>\n<hr data-start=\"6190\" data-end=\"6193\">\n<h3 data-start=\"6195\" data-end=\"6271\"><strong data-start=\"6199\" data-end=\"6271\">Born 2 B feat.

Built on warm keys, boom-bap rhythms, and reflective lyricism, the track centres maturity—what it means to revisit love, forgiveness, and second chances with lived experience rather than nostalgia alone.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6652\" data-end=\"7102\">Born 2 B’s legacy within UK Hip-Hop, particularly his role in shaping the early Ninja Tune sound alongside Us3, gives the track historical weight. Marlene Quest’s soulful chorus anchors the collaboration in emotional immediacy, bridging generations of listeners. In 2026, indie increasingly values lineage and storytelling, and this release stands as a reminder that progression doesn’t require erasing the past—it requires engaging with it honestly.</p>",

Founded in Hastings in 2024, the trio combines several decades-worth of musical knowledge in one pulsing piece that is more introspective than historical. The Golden Years is not an anthem of nostalgia. It is one of resilience, conviction, and the passage of art.<br><br>But front and center in this band is singer/songwriter Danny Goring, a man who deliberately moves away from his folk credentials to forge an electric sound. His songwriting is deeply imbued with classic pop hooks, recalling the efficiency of songwriting in mid-1960s pop music. His chiming guitars call to mind a Byrds sound, although his lyrical direction has a Dylanesque feel for storytelling. But it’s a song which cites post-punk, with a bed of energy evoking REM, Smiths, and Cure.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3indDfOtJBpioodb3sVDlL?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>This is sustained by the rhythm section backing the band. Joe Pruessner's bass playing is sophisticated and informed by his work in an orchestral setting, and Darren Barnes's drumming is subtle and attentive, supporting rather than detract from the song and its lyrical essence.<br>The overall effect is of an honest and assured sound that is lived-in and comes from its own very distinct and confident place.<br><br>With recorded evidence from August of 2025 and mixed masterfully by Swedish producer Nalle Ahlstedt, The Golden Years is afforded production that finds equilibrium between paying respect to its simplicity and letting it breathe. The guitars are shimmering but not overpowering, the drums are appropriately rooted, and Goring's vocals fall well at center stage. There is clarity there, but there is also warmth.<br><br>On a lyrical level, “The Golden Years” charts a path all too familiar to anyone who has hung on through the years for music. There is a nod to youth and optimism, uncertainty and struggles, and all the characters who have populated along the way. As a reflection of success, there is no reward down the line but instead a viewpoint which is gained along the way.<br><br>Inspirations for the Housecarls encompass a large geographical and musical territory, swinging from Greenwich Village, Laurel Canyon, to the Sussex Weald.<br><br>This is because their reluctance to be ‘box[ed] into a single tradition’ is reflected in the range of their songs, which seem to be informed and forward-looking rather than based upon nostalgia or precepts. As a first album, “The Golden Years” brings forth a group that is familiar with who they are and where they’ve been. It does not scream for attention. It listens, thinks, and says what it means. In that sense, “The Housecarls” reminds one that sometimes it is not immediacy that lends songs their strength, but the passage of time.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Televised Mind brings a kind of momentum to the Lincoln music scene which only comes when a band finds something authentic. It all began when Ste began writing songs a bit accidently in 2021. That’s all changed now, as they are one of the most talked-about newcomers in the region. The latest single, 'Word to the Wise,' which comes out on the 5th of December, 2025, just exudes the kind of electricity which comes out when a band discovers who they are and turns the volume so high the walls rattle. This is a band who has a grip on who they are and are making music loud enough to be heard.<br><br>Word to the Wise kicked off with a very relatable opening. Ste came home from a grueling day of work and was exhausted, hardly wanting to say a word, before a mate began yapping away incessantly. This was just irritation enough to set off a spark, and from that, Ste wrote and performed his first song of 2021. It was an explosion of irritation, but of the kind that had a universal beat. The group brought the track to Farm Factory Studios in Hertfordshire, where producers Billy Lunn of The Subways trimmed it down and made it sharp and snappy, reflecting the kick of their 2000s roots without sounding nostalgic. Televised Mind instead tap into that period’s emotional rhythm and channel it through their own sense of agitation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"352\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/75atj6c79FKewhfgqgnN5r?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Televised Mind have based their sound on biting observations and hooks that attack you from an angle, before you realize just how memorable they are.  Ste’s vocal performance synthesizes enough exasperation with enough humor to support itself. The dilemmas of restraint and liberation exist squarely in this corner of Televised Mind’s sound. They are ever on the cusp of letting something anarchic seep into their tight sound. They list inspiration from “Queens of the Stone Age, Bloc Party, Idles, and Amyl &amp; The Sniffers” but there is more than enough for them to retain their “edge” while acknowledging such obvious kin. They write with conviction about experiences from which many people can actually relate. “A lot can happen on any given night. They often find themselves pulled into long hours and long nights. Long, drawn-out conversations that you wish you weren’t having.…They work from exactly what you'd expect to find. They find themselves entrenched directly in 'the every-day’” tension with “the every-day” sound.”<br><br>Presented with the conviction of a unit that knows how to take the drudgery of the mundane frustrations of life and make it a form of catharsis. What separates Televised Mind from the rest of the pack, however, is that instead of simply trying to revitalize the punk or the rock sound, they’re more interested in rediscovering the human element of both, the spark of inspiration that led someone to grab a guitar and scream into a microphone for the very first time. This spark of inspiration can be found in \"Word to the Wise.\" As they swell in profile, however, Televised Mind still take refuge in what originally brought them all together to start with: “the buzz of transforming common irritations into sounds that can still scream louder than the annoyance which originally sparked them off.” “Word to the Wise” is more than their next single release, however – it is instead an insight into “a band still learning to trust their gut and proving that rock still has room for new voices willing to say something real.”</p>",

It stays even after the room falls silent. Harmoniq Journey exists very comfortably in that niche, producing tunes which are more of a statement of a space rather than an actual statement. With the arrival of Drifting Away, the duo has reinforced the emotional nuances of the same by producing a composition which mirrors the unraveling of the same.<br><br>“Drifting Away” is a track that grows at its own rate. Right from the outset, it’s clear that there is a gentle film-score quality to what’s being created here, achieved through synth sounds layered in such a way as to have a spacious rather than crushing effect. The tempo is deliberately relaxed, to the point where nothing ever gets pushed too hard in terms of advancing the track. It’s a strategic measure, inasmuch as there’s a recognition here that sometimes silence is every bit as important as sound.

It’s not the sort that comes crashing in with slamming doors and last speeches, but rather the gentle drifting where people, instances, or even parts of ourselves start to feel just out of touch. This is where “Drifting Away” truly succeeds in conveying its title track, because it does so with such precision and concern for what it’s getting across. The lead vocals are mixed high, imbuing a warm melancholy that never quite descends into sadness.<br><br>It is the openness that brings alive the track. It does not talk about everything in the lyrics; that’s where the power is. It is an invitation to express one’s experiences with the track. This could be the fading away of something intimate and physical as love, the end of a known period of life, and the transition that accompanies personal transformation. It is not up to Harmoniq Journey what the track must make one feel. It provides for the feelings and then leaves the listener.<br><br>But it's the production that is most significant in determining this emotional landscape. The synths are very cinematic, evoking vast open space, whereas the electronic rhythm is soft and lush rather than prominent. There's nothing here that is labored or excessive. Every sound seems to contribute to the mood rather than being a display of technical capability.<br><br>There is also the feeling that Harmoniq Journey is constructing a world with their music in the same way that other artists or bands are. \"Drifting Away\" seems to be the natural evolution of an identity that exists within the realms of atmosphere and introspection. This collective does it best with songs that sound like they are destinations in and of themselves, places for late-night driving, the quiet hours, or midnight wandering with no end in mind. This music understands the weight of quiet and lets the listener meet it halfway.<br><br>It’s the ease with which the track operates within its own emotive sphere that resonates. It doesn’t have to chase the big chorus or change. It rests on a constant emotive current that allows subtle shifts in sound to carry the track. This renders Drifting Away a track that doesn’t ever feel bound to a place and time but can be accessed easily and freely without any specific context. Whether or not Harmoniq Journey requires indulgence, it certainly deserves it. \"Drifting Away\" is a testament to the fact that music can be both soft and powerful, quiet and very meaningful. The song embodies the depths that can be discovered in uncertainty, and in the peculiar comfort that will occasionally present itself in relinquishment. Within a setting that is, more often than not, governed by urgency and excess, there exists a quality in Harmoniq Journey that is far more elusive, one that bids you to simply drift and listen.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"dropcap\">Spotify is marking the beginning of a new era of musical recommendations by empowering users to create playlists of their own choice simply by writing down what they want to listen to. Spotify, known to constantly come up with some innovative solution, presents to users another amazing product called “Prompted Playlists” that use artificial intelligence to create playlists based on the music idea users want to listen to.<br><br>\"Until now, Spotify's algorithmic recommendations, such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar, operated in the background, shaping what millions of users around the world heard every day. But with the new feature, instead of just letting the algorithm try to decipher what you like and no one else, you can now tell it what you want, using natural language, like \"I'd like upbeat indie songs to listen to on a rainy commute\" and \"Start with energizing pop and hip-hop songs to run to and calm-down sounds after a workout,\" and it will scour your entire listening history, as well as your recent activity, to curate a playlist based on what you specify and what your musical path has taken you on, based on what you like and what you've liked before.\"<br><br>The new feature rolled out its beta version on December 11th, 2025, and it is only available to Spotify Premium users in New Zealand, which is the first country Spotify has targeted prior to the universal rollout.<br><br><strong>The Difference about Prompted Playlists Compared to Previous Solutions </strong></p>\n<p><br>The key thing that distinguishes the latest playlists as a solution compared to the technology available before it has to do with the level of detail that the consumers are given the freedom to insert into their requests. As opposed to the required details being such broad parameters as “sport” or “relax,” the consumers are able to insert parameters such as genres, periods, mood, rates, and even cultural movements.<br>Spotify</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each playlist that could be created with that prompt comes with an explanation of how songs were selected, which provides the user with insight into the logic the system used to decide which songs to pick in response to the user's query and listening habits, which, according to Spotify, allows it to be a more personalized experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br>The company has also provided starting examples for those who are having trouble thinking of their own, such as combinations based off of famous tours and songs that match a certain mood.<br><br>The executives at Spotify describe “Prompted Playlists” as an incarnation of a new approach to music discovery that de-emphasizes predictiveness and leans toward an interactive process whereby the user has a direct input into what they listen to. “This is the first feature that puts control of the algorithm and the overall Spotify experience directly in your hands,” said the company, as they described an aspiration to make music discovery an “intentional,” “responsive,” and “contextual” process.<br><br><br>This offering follows on the back of experimentation involving AI-assisted playlisting tools, such as the AI Playlist product that Spotify trialed in countries such as the U.K. and Australia back in 2024 but with the new tool called Prompted Playlists adding more depth to the personalization elements and how AI responds to music-related prompts. As Spotify continues to develop and enhance their AI tools, Prompted Playlists suggests a future where a user can literally verbalize their dream playlist, and it will come to life, all within the same application. However, based on how successful the beta experience has been in New Zealand, this may be about to change what a music playlist means in a world of streaming.</p>",
