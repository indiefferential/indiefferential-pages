            "content_html": "<p>There are moments in modern technology that feel curiously familiar, like déjà vu served with a monthly bill. A soft-spoken email appears in your inbox. The price has gone up. Again. You breathe out heavily, mutter some unprintable word under your breath about “shareholder value,” and then, prompted as if on cue, someone else enters the room, looks at the bill, and says, “Funny you should mention that… we haven’t changed our price at all.” Such was the case when Spotify raised its subscription price once again, prompting Apple Music to raise an eyebrow and smirk in response.<br><br>“BTW, we’re still the same price.” That was it. One sentence. No exclamation marks. No emojis. No direct reference to Spotify whatsoever. But everyone knew exactly what was meant. It was corporate shade at its finest, less tabloid newspaper, more dinner party jab delivered over crystal glasses. Within minutes of its posting on X, the post spread like wildfire across tech blogs everywhere, reigniting one of the longest-standing feuds in modern music streaming history: Apple Music vs. Spotify. Not on music charts, not on spreadsheets. On timing. And timing, as Apple knows better than anyone else in the world, is everything.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/k2jr48Th/image.png\" alt=\"image\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><br><br><strong>When the Bill Goes Up, the Mood Goes Down</strong><br><br>Spotify’s price increases have become like bad weather: predictable, unwelcome, and somehow always worse than you thought it was going to be. In the past year alone, subscription price increases have crept up across the United States, Europe, and Latin America under the familiar guise of “platform improvements” and “sustainable growth.”<br><br>And to be fair, Spotify isn't wrong. The cost of running the largest music streaming service on the planet is high. Licensing is expensive. Podcasts don't come cheap. Engineers, servers, and office space with exposed brick don't grow on trees. From a business perspective, Spotify is perfectly within its rights to raise its prices.<br><br>But we, the consumer, don't think in terms of spreadsheets or boardroom decisions. We think in spreadsheets of our own, the kind where Netflix went up, YouTube Premium went up, cloud storage snuck its way up, and the apps we thought we could afford to waste our time on now want the cost of a decent lunch every month.<br><br>And so, when Spotify raises its prices, it doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in an atmosphere of exhaustion. And it was into this atmosphere that Apple Music found the opening of a stadium.<br><br><strong>Apple Music’s Post: Small, Sharp, and Devastatingly Calm</strong><br><br>Apple Music didn't respond to Spotify. It didn't need to. The genius was in what it didn't say. There were no accusations, no gloating, simply the realization that everyone else seems to be passing the collection plate, but Apple Music is, apparently, standing still.<br><br>It was marketing judo, where Spotify swung the biggest punch, but Apple Music took the force of it and gently tipped it over.<br><br>Screenshots went viral. The tech press did what it does best: overanalyze the tone, the timing, the intent. The truth is, however, much simpler. Apple Music knew exactly how this would play out because they understand one thing about the consumer better than anyone else. People hate feeling nickelled and dimed, but love knowing they have choices.<br><br><strong>Two Giants, Two Philosophies</strong><br><br>Spotify and Apple Music are not simply competitors, they are philosophical opposites.<br><br>Spotify is expansive. It’s everywhere. It’s got free tiers and paid tiers and podcasts and audiobooks and algorithmically created playlists that seem to intuitively recognize your sadness before you’ve even realized you’re sad. It’s loud and social and infinitely customizable. To the user, Spotify might as well be the internet in music form.<br><br>Apple Music, meanwhile, is the opposite. It’s controlled. It’s curated. It doesn’t have a free tier. It doesn’t have chaos. It’s all about sound quality. It’s all about the ability to play lossless music and to integrate seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem. If you own an iPhone, a pair of AirPods, a MacBook, and an Apple Watch for some reason, then Apple Music just fits.<br><br>And the key here is this: when two services are relatively equal in price, the price becomes the determining factor. The minute price increase becomes the moment where the user thinks to themselves, “Wait a minute. Why exactly am I paying more for this again?”<br><br>Apple Music didn’t need to educate the user about the benefits of their service. Apple Music didn’t need to create a chart. Apple Music simply pointed at the price tag and said, “Hey, buddy. You’re welcome to go elsewhere. We’re not really concerned with your business.” <br><br><strong>Streaming’s New Phase: Less Growth, More Grit</strong><br><br>There was a time when music streaming services were all about growth. Growth was the end goal. Growth was the be-all and end-all. New users were the holy grail. Prices were kept low, trials were long, and everyone was just happy to pretend this was a viable long-term strategy.<br><br>Well, those days are behind us.<br><br>But let's be clear: this isn’t generosity. It’s strategy. Apple can afford to play the long game with music as part of a much broader overall picture. Spotify, as a streaming-first company, doesn’t have the luxury of playing the long game.<br><br><strong>Social Media: The New Battlefield</strong><br><br>So what makes this all particularly fascinating is the manner in which this played out. In the old days, a company might release a press statement with all the requisite PR doublespeak. Today, one tweet does more damage or good than a thousand-word press release.<br><br>Apple Music didn’t debate the point. It didn’t defend itself. It simply existed loudly at the exact moment Spotify made itself vulnerable. And the Internet did the rest.<br><br>This, dear reader, is the new world of brand warfare: fast, subtle, and ruthlessly effective.<br><br><strong>What It Means for the Consumer</strong><br><br>So what does this all mean for the consumer? The good news: it’s refreshingly simple. If Spotify’s prices are too high for you, well, Apple Music’s prices are the same as they were yesterday. If Apple Music doesn’t have the playlists or podcasts you love, well, Spotify will be happy to keep you as a customer for a slightly higher price.<br><br>At the end of the day, consumers really only care about three things: the price, the sound quality, and the user interface. And for the first time ever, price is climbing the list faster than ever.<br><br><strong>Final Notes from the Streaming Front</strong><br><br>So Apple Music’s statement may have been brief, but it said a thousand words. It said a lot about a market in trouble, a consumer base at the breaking point, and a rivalry far from over. One company hiked prices. The other gave a sly eyebrow.<br><br>And in the world of streaming today, the sly eyebrow might be the most deadly move of all.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up too?</strong><br><br>Well, at the moment I’m a full time uni student studying music in London. I’m doing a performance and production course, which I’m having so much fun with! I’ve been learning how to produce my own music and even doing my own compositions as I’m now learning to play piano too. I’ve always loved performing, so I’m really enjoying delving deeper into the music industry in a new way. Alongside this, with the release of ‘Control Freak’, I’ve been trying to build my online presence across my social media platforms and it’s been really fun filming new types of content to post so that people get to know me as an artist and as a person.<br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong><br><br>For me, I just want people to enjoy my music. I want anyone who feels like they can relate to my songs, to be able to turn up the volume and head-bang to the lyrics or shout them out! I want to tour the world one day because I love being up on a stage and I love interacting with a crowd. Honestly, it means so much to me when someone tells me they can resonate with one of my songs, and that’s what I would define as a success. So, I guess my long term goal is to keep doing what I’m doing, but on a larger scale. I want to get my music out there, and it’s something I’m not going to give up on!</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/7GfLRo8U1dHsRJ5xpdFBMZ?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br><strong>How did you start?</strong><br><br>I’ve always loved singing from a very young age and I can remember being in the car with my mum and singing along to different CD’s she had whenever we would go out. It was only when I was ten-years-old, that I realised I wanted to be an artist and that being on stage was just something I loved. I was on holiday at a caravan park and they were putting on a talent competition, which I decided to enter last minute. I remember being so nervous before going up on stage, I got upset and almost didn’t do it. Yet, as soon as I got up there and started singing, I didn’t want to stop! I knew from that moment that it was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. From there, I ended up winning the competition and got to the National finals! I will always be grateful that I ended up getting on stage that day, as it really was the doorway that led me to where I am now.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/FkRp7G5r/image10-1.jpg\" alt=\"image10 (1)\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong><br><br>Right now, as an independent artist, it’s really just about trying to push myself out there and making noise about the new release! I’m always writing new music, and now that I’m at uni learning to do so much more, I’m able to put that into practise at home as well. As I mentioned previously, I’m always planning on new content to post on social media, and I’m trying at the moment to post multiple things everyday to keep my pages active. I have a lot of fun filming TikTok’s especially and recording song covers, so I guess a typical day really just consists of music and anything interesting I can post haha.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I have never used AI in any of my music and personally it’s not something I’d probably ever use when it comes to creating anything musically. I’m a very creative person, so AI kind of takes that away from me and anyone else who enjoys the creative process of writing or composing a song. I understand that people use AI in a lot of different ways, but when you have people who work so hard putting their creative vision into a song and then compare it with a song made entirely from AI, I feel like it takes the opportunities away from that creative individual. It’s definitely a big conversation in the music industry at the moment, and I think in any creative industry too.<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong><br><br>My song ‘Control Freak’ has just come out and I have to say it’s definitely one of my favourite songs I’ve done! It’s so petty and sarcastic, but it’s also a lot of fun to listen and sing along too. I feel like everyone at some point in their lives has dealt with who they’d label a ‘control freak’ and sometimes it’s nice to be able to air that frustration out in a bold and sassy way! It’s quite a different vibe to my other songs, but I love experimenting with different sounds and different genres too. I worked with an incredible producer, Jim Hustwit, who was able to create something exactly how I’d envisioned when I wrote the song.</p>",

Lately, I’ve been deep in album mode: finishing songs, refining visuals, and building a world around my upcoming music that feels honest and lived-in. (All while trying to balance my personal life and all of its’ chaos!)</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/LDGjgj9S/image.jpg\" alt=\"image\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?<br></strong><br>Success, to me, is longevity and integrity. It’s making work that feels true to who I am even as I change, and finding the people who feel seen in it/can relate to it. The goal isn’t virality for a moment but rather connection over time. If my songs become something someone returns to during different seasons of their life, that’s success.<br><br><strong>How did you start?<br></strong><br>I started writing songs long before I ever thought of releasing them mostly as a way to process things in a constructive manner. Music was always where I could be the most honest, but also the most vulnerable. cooper mae came way later, when I realized I didn’t want these songs to live quietly just on paper anymore. It felt less like “starting a project” and more like finally letting myself take up space in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09WvwzsALKs7YlPyWBlwGX?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?<br></strong><br>There’s no such thing as a truly typical day, which I think is part of the magic. Some days are very unglamorous. Voice memos, rewrites, mixing, admin tasks, social media, emails. Other days are purely creative: writing lyrics, experimenting with production, or perfecting a melody that won’t leave my head. And then you also have the couch potato days, where I do nothing related to music what so ever. The through-line is consistency though. Showing up again and again even after taking some time off. <br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?<br></strong><br>I see AI as a tool, not a replacement. It can be useful for brainstorming or speeding up certain workflows, but it can’t replicate lived experience, nuance, or emotional risk. The most compelling music still comes from being human and a little (a lot) uncomfortable. AI can assist the process, but it can’t write your truth for you. That’s the best part of art. That’s what keeps it raw and human. <br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.<br></strong><br>My upcoming work is something that I like to call slightly unhinged honesty. My new album (‘notes from the archive’ release date TBD) is introspective and emotionally sharp, but still catchy and also quite intimate. The songs are really exploring day to day themes like modern love, self-awareness culture, feminism, and emotional accountability. Just with a bit of humor and bite. To me, it became a collection that feels like flipping through a private archive of thoughts you maybe weren’t supposed to read, but immediately recognize and relate to. I’m really excited to drop it.</p>",

I balance motherhood in the day and work on my music once the kids go to bed for the night. In between I do studio sessions and vocal lessons and a whole lot of research on how I can be better and more successful haha.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I actually came across my first AI artist and the music was fantastic but sadly I think if it continues then it’ll eventually take over and labels will prioritise AI artists because it’ll be less work and more money for them. It’ll kill the music industry. Personally, I think it needs to be stopped before it gets too much and harder to control.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/p6495Hq5/Markoe-Press-Shot-3-2.png\" alt=\"Markoe Press Shot 3 2\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"flex-grow-1\">\n<div class=\"rounded bg-black rounded-bottom-right-0 p-2\">\n<div class=\"MSG-TXT text-white\"><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>My latest release is called ‘Birthday Song’ and it’s about feeling disappointment on your birthday (something I feel every year). It was 2 days before my birthday when I wrote it and it was written in a very raw moment as I just needed to get it all off of my chest. Although it’s sad, I tried to insert a message of empowerment “I prefer my own flare” so that when people listen to it and feel they can relate, they can also feel self-love and appreciation for themselves. Sometimes, we need a song we can cry to as not everyone’s birthday odds joyful and full of partying (I write for people who want to feel heard and understood).</p>",

The French-English vocals are reminiscent of a diary left open at 4 a.m., an album that deals with desire, guilt, and insomnia in a minimalist, beautiful way, a kind of music that makes you remember why you listen to music in the first place, or write it at all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pointer-events-none h-px w-px absolute bottom-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-edge=\"true\"><hr></div>\n<p><strong>“Nuit Blanche” feels like a diary entry set to music. How much of the song came from a real sleepless night, and how much was shaped later in the studio?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, most of my songs come from sleepless nights. I recorded this one in my apartment in the middle of the night. Though it was re-written and re-arranged multiple times, the production of the track was made in the same atmosphere as the one it evokes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4G00kv3HLRDnA7ZHjGMxWP?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>You switch between French and English in the track. What does each language allow you to express emotionally that the other doesn’t?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hook (in French) was the first part of the song that I came up with. The term “Nuit Blanche” which refers to a sleepless night literally means “white night”, which I thought had many avenues for creative exploration. As I continued writing, I realised that because I wanted the lyrics to read like a train of thought, it would flow more naturally if it read the same way I think, which is back and forth between French and English. The switch in languages is also a form of protection. Whenever I felt myself getting too vulnerable during the writing process I would switch languages so that people wouldn’t understand the next sentence (unless they’re bilingual, of course).</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Mk8qshb6/image00002.jpg\" alt=\"image00002\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Compared to “Rotting Away In You” and “I Hate Camping,” this song feels more fragile and confessional. Was that a conscious shift in tone, or did it happen naturally?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m working on an album at the moment that loosely follows the journey that your brain goes on when you can’t sleep, therefore I want each song to represent a stage of insomnia. R.A.I.Y and I.H.C are both meant to be more lighthearted points in the record, whereas Nuit Blanche is all about overthinking in the middle of the night.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://indiefferential.com/magazine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4Zm2VB3r/indiefferential-magazine-11.jpg\" alt=\"indiefferential magazine (11)\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Insomnia, guilt, desire, self-doubt,  these are very internal themes. Do you find it easier to write about your inner world than external experiences?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often use songwriting as a form of therapy, so in theory yes, however the themes in this track are heavily influenced by external experiences. Whether I’m writing about my feelings, something that happened, or something that didn’t, I always try to center the story around the feelings. That’s what reaches people. Life circumstances vary greatly, but we feel mostly the same things.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/35YCYTxN/image00003.jpg\" alt=\"image00003\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Living in Paris as an Irish artist, how has that change in environment influenced your sound or perspective as a songwriter?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned so much here in Paris about music and art, as it is such a culturally rich city. I think that the blend of cultures can be heard in my music and it gives me a unique style and perspective. People in France are a lot more into music theory than other places, and that has helped me develop my composition skills. I also think there is a rural vs. metropolitan difference. Paris is so huge and busy, whereas I come from the countryside. Our ears get used to completely different things. </span></p>\n<p><strong>If “Nuit Blanche” were a scene in a film, what would we see and where would the listener be sitting in that moment?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I imagine a kind of ‘Taxi Driver’ atmosphere, someone sitting on a dark street in a car. I also think it could be kind of a trippy chase scene like in ‘Requiem For A Dream’.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The political drama that has hung over the head of TikTok for several years has finally been resolved in a way that might even give the most seasoned tech entrepreneur pause. After over a year of negotiation, legal deadlines, and congressional mandates, the social media giant has officially created a new entity, effectively allowing it to continue to do business in the States while also appeasing the security concerns that threatened to take the app off phones nationwide. This is all thanks to a new entity called \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\"<br><br>At its heart, this is a deal between Washington’s tech wariness and the simple fact of TikTok’s size, its reach, and its profitability: this company is not going away. The company will be majority-owned by American and global investors, led by Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX—while ByteDance, its parent company based in Beijing, retains a minority position of less than 20%. This is a deal designed around a piece of federal legislation set to pass in 2024 that would have mandated a sale or banned TikTok.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6an6lqcIRe7x5IPUULpN7l?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>U.S. operations fall under the purview of a seven-member board structure with TikTok's global CEO Shou Chew still involved and TikTok veteran Adam Presser appointed as the CEO of the joint venture. \"The change will ensure the safety of American users' data and compliance with the United States' cybersecurity standards without impacting the millions of people who use the app every day.\"<br><br>Yet behind the veneer of this “win-win” arrangement, there remains a chorus of lawmakers and critics concerned with the devil in the details. Skeptics of this arrangement include members of Congress themselves, who urge further investigation to determine if this arrangement truly cuts foreign influence or merely rebranding them with a new name. Questions also arise as to how transparent this data management will truly be with Oracle’s cloud services and retraining of its recommendation systems to address long-held security concerns. For the app's roughly 200 million users in the U.S., creators, consumers, and brands alike, nothing has changed just yet: the whirlwind of videos, dances, and micro-communities continues unimpeded.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://indiefferential.com/magazine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4Zm2VB3r/indiefferential-magazine-11.jpg\" alt=\"indiefferential magazine (11)\" border=\"0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But in the background, the narrative of TikTok in the U.S. now sounds like that of a startup redux rather than the current reality. Like any significant change in the tech industry, the end result of this will continue to play out in all sorts of ways, from Capitol Hill to the comments section of your favorite creator's latest upload.</p>",
