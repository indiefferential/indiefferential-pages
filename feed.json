I balance motherhood in the day and work on my music once the kids go to bed for the night. In between I do studio sessions and vocal lessons and a whole lot of research on how I can be better and more successful haha.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I actually came across my first AI artist and the music was fantastic but sadly I think if it continues then it’ll eventually take over and labels will prioritise AI artists because it’ll be less work and more money for them. It’ll kill the music industry. Personally, I think it needs to be stopped before it gets too much and harder to control.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/p6495Hq5/Markoe-Press-Shot-3-2.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Markoe Press Shot 3 2\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"flex-grow-1\">\n<div class=\"rounded bg-black rounded-bottom-right-0 p-2\">\n<div class=\"MSG-TXT text-white\"><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>My latest release is called ‘Birthday Song’ and it’s about feeling disappointment on your birthday (something I feel every year). It was 2 days before my birthday when I wrote it and it was written in a very raw moment as I just needed to get it all off of my chest. Although it’s sad, I tried to insert a message of empowerment “I prefer my own flare” so that when people listen to it and feel they can relate, they can also feel self-love and appreciation for themselves. Sometimes, we need a song we can cry to as not everyone’s birthday odds joyful and full of partying (I write for people who want to feel heard and understood).</p>",

And yet, an email popped up in my inbox from a name that was familiar to me, an artist that I’d written about previously, and it was like that was the thread that connected that stillness of the night to everything that’s been going on in music.<br><br>Somewhere in the space between the car and the street lights, Nuit Blanche by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marrnotmeeger/\">Marr Not Meeger</a> started to play in my headphones. The French-English vocals are reminiscent of a diary left open at 4 a.m., an album that deals with desire, guilt, and insomnia in a minimalist, beautiful way, a kind of music that makes you remember why you listen to music in the first place, or write it at all.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pointer-events-none h-px w-px absolute bottom-0\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-edge=\"true\"><hr></div>\n<p><strong>“Nuit Blanche” feels like a diary entry set to music. How much of the song came from a real sleepless night, and how much was shaped later in the studio?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, most of my songs come from sleepless nights. I recorded this one in my apartment in the middle of the night. Though it was re-written and re-arranged multiple times, the production of the track was made in the same atmosphere as the one it evokes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4G00kv3HLRDnA7ZHjGMxWP?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>You switch between French and English in the track. What does each language allow you to express emotionally that the other doesn’t?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hook (in French) was the first part of the song that I came up with. The term “Nuit Blanche” which refers to a sleepless night literally means “white night”, which I thought had many avenues for creative exploration. As I continued writing, I realised that because I wanted the lyrics to read like a train of thought, it would flow more naturally if it read the same way I think, which is back and forth between French and English. The switch in languages is also a form of protection. Whenever I felt myself getting too vulnerable during the writing process I would switch languages so that people wouldn’t understand the next sentence (unless they’re bilingual, of course).</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Mk8qshb6/image00002.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"image00002\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Compared to “Rotting Away In You” and “I Hate Camping,” this song feels more fragile and confessional. Was that a conscious shift in tone, or did it happen naturally?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m working on an album at the moment that loosely follows the journey that your brain goes on when you can’t sleep, therefore I want each song to represent a stage of insomnia. R.A.I.Y and I.H.C are both meant to be more lighthearted points in the record, whereas Nuit Blanche is all about overthinking in the middle of the night.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://indiefferential.com/magazine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4Zm2VB3r/indiefferential-magazine-11.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"indiefferential magazine (11)\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Insomnia, guilt, desire, self-doubt,  these are very internal themes. Do you find it easier to write about your inner world than external experiences?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often use songwriting as a form of therapy, so in theory yes, however the themes in this track are heavily influenced by external experiences. Whether I’m writing about my feelings, something that happened, or something that didn’t, I always try to center the story around the feelings. That’s what reaches people. Life circumstances vary greatly, but we feel mostly the same things.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/35YCYTxN/image00003.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"image00003\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>Living in Paris as an Irish artist, how has that change in environment influenced your sound or perspective as a songwriter?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned so much here in Paris about music and art, as it is such a culturally rich city. I think that the blend of cultures can be heard in my music and it gives me a unique style and perspective. People in France are a lot more into music theory than other places, and that has helped me develop my composition skills. I also think there is a rural vs. metropolitan difference. Paris is so huge and busy, whereas I come from the countryside. Our ears get used to completely different things. </span></p>\n<p><strong>If “Nuit Blanche” were a scene in a film, what would we see and where would the listener be sitting in that moment?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I imagine a kind of ‘Taxi Driver’ atmosphere, someone sitting on a dark street in a car. I also think it could be kind of a trippy chase scene like in ‘Requiem For A Dream’.</span></p>",

After over a year of negotiation, legal deadlines, and congressional mandates, the social media giant has officially created a new entity, effectively allowing it to continue to do business in the States while also appeasing the security concerns that threatened to take the app off phones nationwide. This is all thanks to a new entity called \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\"<br><br>At its heart, this is a deal between Washington’s tech wariness and the simple fact of TikTok’s size, its reach, and its profitability: this company is not going away. The company will be majority-owned by American and global investors, led by Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX—while ByteDance, its parent company based in Beijing, retains a minority position of less than 20%. This is a deal designed around a piece of federal legislation set to pass in 2024 that would have mandated a sale or banned TikTok.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6an6lqcIRe7x5IPUULpN7l?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>U.S. operations fall under the purview of a seven-member board structure with TikTok's global CEO Shou Chew still involved and TikTok veteran Adam Presser appointed as the CEO of the joint venture. \"The change will ensure the safety of American users' data and compliance with the United States' cybersecurity standards without impacting the millions of people who use the app every day.\"<br><br>Yet behind the veneer of this “win-win” arrangement, there remains a chorus of lawmakers and critics concerned with the devil in the details. Skeptics of this arrangement include members of Congress themselves, who urge further investigation to determine if this arrangement truly cuts foreign influence or merely rebranding them with a new name. Questions also arise as to how transparent this data management will truly be with Oracle’s cloud services and retraining of its recommendation systems to address long-held security concerns. For the app's roughly 200 million users in the U.S., creators, consumers, and brands alike, nothing has changed just yet: the whirlwind of videos, dances, and micro-communities continues unimpeded.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://indiefferential.com/magazine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4Zm2VB3r/indiefferential-magazine-11.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"indiefferential magazine (11)\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But in the background, the narrative of TikTok in the U.S. now sounds like that of a startup redux rather than the current reality.

            "content_html": "<p>In early 2026, something big happened in music circles. Bandcamp, which has traditionally been seen as an oasis for independent voices and genuine artistry, announced its decision to <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-announces-ban-on-ai-music/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bar music created entirely or in part by artificial intelligence from its site</a>. The message is unmistakable: Bandcamp is dedicated to ensuring that musicians and listeners know their music is created by human beings, not machines.<br><br>It's this policy that differentiates Bandcamp from the majority of the prominent music streaming websites that have already begun witnessing a rise in the number of AI-generated tracks on their websites. In fact, on many prominent music streaming websites such as Spotify and Deezer, there has been a rise in the number of AI-generated tracks that have been uploaded on the website within the last year. In fact, on many such websites, the overall percentage of AI-generated tracks that have been estimated to have been uploaded on the website ranges between 18-34%. Moreover, the majority of the users have not been able to identify the difference between human-generated tracks and those that have been created using AI.<br><br>This is particularly evidenced in Bandcamp’s choice, which represents a larger cultural tension: the need for the music industry to strike a delicate balance between innovation and integrity. On the one hand, there are innovative producers such as Suno, Udio, and ElevenLabs, which have been touting the power to democratize music making and make it more accessible. These producers have been securing high-profile partnerships, large funding rounds, and touting the power of AI to collaborate with, rather than replace, musicians. For example, ElevenLabs’ recent album, titled “The Eleven Album,” includes vocal samples from both Liza Minnelli and Art Garfunkel, along with other AI-generated features.<br><br>On the other side, however, is a growing movement of artists, rights holders, and music lovers who fear that, by utilizing AI, music itself is losing its very foundation. Around the world, thousands of artists have united in opposition to unlicensed AI model training and low-quality \"AI slop.\" In fact, some countries’ regulatory bodies have begun taking steps, as Sweden has officially removed a song created almost entirely by AI technology from its music charts, arguing that music without some level of human participation should not qualify for inclusion.<br><br>The significance of this for musicians cannot be overstated. Bandcamp's prohibition of AI isn’t the same as the rejection of technology per se. In this sense, the platform doesn’t entirely prohibit the utilization of AI, merely for small purposes such as cleaning or suggesting. However, the message it sends out to the music industry and the artists within it is quite definitive. There appears to be a section of the industry that continues to respect the craftsmanship of the individual. The music landscape itself is evolving. AI is redefining music creation, discovery, and distribution. The argument around AI and music creation will only get sharper. Some will see AI and AI-generated music as progress. Others will see AI-generated music as an attempt to commodity creativity and silence genuine human voices. The move by Bandcamp will not end this argument. Instead, it will represent a defining point where arguments around music’s future are no longer confined to boardrooms. They are now within music itself.</p>",

My mom was largely self-taught on piano and guitar and wanted me to have the formal training she wasn’t able to have for herself, so I took classical piano lessons from around age 5. I started writing songs in the fifth grade, during my free time at school. Later in high school I got really into theatre, and after college I spent a number of years auditioning and doing shows while also gigging as a singer-songwriter. Eventually, the music part took over, though I still love theatre and enjoy combining those two art forms together when I compose for film.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on the day, but usually some combination of writing, recording and teaching music.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, art is about the human experience, flawed and messy though it may be. If you’re removing that element, what’s the point? The writing and arranging of the music is the most fun part as far as I’m concerned, so outsourcing that to an algorithm is not at all appealing to me. Even when I’m stuck on a lyric or struggling to figure out some aspect of the music, I’d rather just wrestle with that or even collaborate with another human artist and see where that takes things. Art is about the process, not just an end product.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4TitSN1ZERVRAjzKPlnfQZ?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over It” is about finding yourself in a challenging situation where you hope that a certain person in your life is going to rise to the occasion, but, for whatever reason, they just don’t have it in them.

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Driven Paper isn’t just a service provider—it’s described as a creative ally. What does that partnership look like in practice?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driven Paper provides essential services for artists looking to elevate in their craft. Yes we assist artists looking to get major distribution but there's so much more involved.  The Team surrounding is a handful of goal getters with a common purpose and goal. We have Magazine writers, Festival Organizers, Stage Management, former music managers, Pr's, Dj's, event planners and entrepreneurs.  We actually care what happens to our artists and helping guide them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Festival coordination and professional stage management are major pillars of the brand. How does mastering the live side of music change an artist’s long-term trajectory?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely, once our artists are plugged in with us, We try to help facilitate their journey by way of interviews, shows, appearances and more.  We don't harvest studio only artists, we also help them with stage presence and help teach them the business. In the long run, we help get artists ready for the next step. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://audiomack.com//embed/dpcmovementsrecords/album/next-the-mixtape-driven-paper-next-level\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Next\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>With hands-on A&amp;R insight at the core of your approach, how do you identify artists who are ready to grow rather than just release music?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's all in their sound, confidence and how they carry themselves.</span></p>\n<p><strong>As the music landscape becomes increasingly digital, how does Driven Paper balance online growth with real-world presence and performance?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This team is literally Outside always interacting, networking and building relationships with influencers, media, artists and other creatives while maintaining a strong media presence. We are plugged to numerous key festivals and events to help push the culture forward. Artists connected to the brand receives great visibility by being apart of major events that keep pushing itself forward.</span></p>\n<p><strong>After a five-year hiatus, what ultimately called you back into the entertainment world and what had changed most within you during that time?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this was like a movie, literally, at my day job I had been racially profiled working at Police headquarters in my city. This went so far that I was forced to shut down my record label and go back to regular life so to speak.  In the end, I was wrongly accused and was issued an apology, being charged with an attempted murder that never happened. Finally, I was awarded by the police a recognition award for my outstanding work with the individuals I work with awesome autistic, bipolar, schizophrenic and down syndrome aggressive adults. So after 5 years of sitting on the sidelines, I was done watching and not contributing to the scene so in September 2022 I made my return and decided to raise the bar even higher by getting involved in more community based events, aligning myself with Sony Music to facilitate distribution and starting writing for a magazine..many things to help out artists in the process. What changed was the scene, the new mentality and the new outlook when it came to working together. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/whjf0bVJ/Photo-Credit-Link-Prezzy.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Photo Credit Link Prezzy\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><strong>AI is changing how music is created, distributed, and even marketed. Do you see AI as a threat to independent artists or as the ultimate empowerment tool when used correctly?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be used creatively to be honest for many things but when we start hearing AI artists are signed to multi million dollar contracts and topping charts,we really need to look at the bigger picture and how we can at least meet at a common ground.</span></p>\n<p><strong>As streaming payouts continue to be debated, do you believe independence is becoming less about freedom and more about strategy?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's all calculated strategic moves now. You have a strong team surrounding you that facilitates visibility, continuous elevation and savage marketing team then best believe things will happen at a faster pace. Work smarter, not harder.</span></p>\n<p><strong>With AI capable of mimicking voices and styles, what becomes the artist’s most valuable asset moving forward?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I feel that artists with a real story and make music that hits home hard will always surpass the fluff, as I call it. AUTHENTICITY or GIMMICKS do work still to be honest but if you can stir up an authentic audience locally, regionally or nationally ,you will keep your fans engaged while growing new ones.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The hype about AI in music today is just so loud, as if all songs put out from now on will somehow be composed, recorded, or finalized by a computer. The headlines scream about the impending arrival of “the machine” for musicians. As if musicians are about to become unnecessary. It all does seem a bit sensational. But there does seem to be something quietly fascinating going on in 2026, something which has completely flown under the radar: people have begun listening again.<br><br>But before you assume this is just like every other “artists versus AI” discussion, consider what’s actually at stake. Nobody hates technology. Everyone loves tools, plugins, and software that help make music better. What they’re starting to reject is perfection. Perfection that is mathematically accurate, technically perfect, and devoid of any human flaws is no longer exciting. That’s boring. That’s safe. That’s like something that was recorded by an artist who has never struggled, failed, or taken a risk to get to a mic.<br><br>But human music, with all its minute timing variances, its \"broken\" vocals, its inconsistent phrasing, and unpredictable melodies, sounds as if it's alive. It sounds as if someone has actually lived it. The minute flaws are what give it character. They give it tension. They give it a reason to listen to it a second time. And that's something that no computer can ever reproduce. A computer can mimic a performance, but it can't live it. That's still the domain of the human musician.<br><br>The data is already beginning to show up in streaming metrics. Songs that can accept small flaws and irregular rhythms are better at retaining listener attention. They are getting more adds on playlists, more shares, and more heated discussion. Listeners are increasingly preferring music that takes risks and has feeling over music that is simply perfect in its mechanical execution.<br><br>So, what does this mean for musicians who are concerned about AI? Well, the tools are not the problem. The problem is in not remembering what makes you different. Your voice, phrasing, errors, and perspectives cannot be duplicated. These are the things you have over others, and in the year 2026, having an edge is a valuable thing once more.<br><br>The irony is that it is in its relentless pursuit of efficiency that AI may very well force musicians to remember what they are doing best. Those musicians who incorporate the human element in their work, allow it to breathe, and allow for its unpredictability in playing will find that audiences are once again taking notice. So, as a musician concerned about the threat of AI, here’s the truth: stop trying to be perfect. Don’t emulate a recipe. Create the music you would want to hear, the music with your story in it. Tools are just tools. The music isn’t about the tool—it’s about you. In a world where people seem more and more obsessed with perfecting their craft through artificial means, it’s the human factor that has become the key advantage. And in 2026, it’s been a long time since it’s been this strong.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>King Colobus spent a decade shaping Torn Between Age &amp; Perseverance, recording alone in South Devon and turning personal and political weight into baritone driven alternative blues. Songs like Hole confront dementia with restraint, while World On Fire reflects uneasy modern realities. Known for BBC Introducing support and fearless collaboration, Stewart Macpherson arrives here focused and patient, delivering an album that values reflection, endurance, and emotional honesty over immediacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm currently focusing on the launch of my album. Being a self-released project, this is taking up a lot of time, but it should be worth the wait!</p>\n<p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding success, I feel like any day when someone discovers (and enjoys) what I do is a day to celebrate. Not the quantity, but the quality. My goal has always been to organically grow and discover places and people through music.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p>\n<p>I originally started in a band called Faith Healer when I was 15 years old. It's hard to believe that this was 35 years ago, but I was thown right into the deep end, so I learnt a lot from that experience. I then moved onto a few other bands before relocating to London, where I formed another group called We Were For. I also carried out various session work, which was a new experience that also helped me to further develop as an artist. I returned to Devon in 2012 and formed King Colobus with some old mates, but it always felt like a solo project with 3 other people, hence the reason why it ended up as a solo endeavour.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/36x14Zy1ZW2cq6r8DsSxuK?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p>\n<p>My typical day as an artist is pretty sporadic...I work as a kitchen designer by day and I have a family - not terribly 'rock n' roll', so I have to find pockets of time to focus on the music. There's a lot of material that one can absorb from day-to-day life and it helps inject reality into my musical content.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding AI, I don't think any of my material could have been created with it in the round, but I can see why some people use it as a tool. Whilst none of my music has been produced with it, I did use it for some artwork...I would have had to torch a village to get the front cover of the album and for obvious reasons, this was not an option!<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p>\n<p>'Torn Between Age &amp; Perseverance' is exactly what it says on the tin. Given my age, I have been dabbling with the idea of firing up the band again, but this is fraught with the challenges that life throws at all of us. It's an album about politics, religion, personal grief, insecurity and our inevitable ability to be self-distructive.</p>",
