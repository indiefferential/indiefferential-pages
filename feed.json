            "content_html": "<p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, I’m spending a lot of time in my recording studio, juggling a few very different projects. I’m finishing up several of my own songs, with the intention of releasing an EP later this year. I’m also currently scoring a short film and producing some songs with my friend and singer-songwriter Alyson Greenfield.</span></p>\n<p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Really, I just want to keep doing this as long as possible, and I’m grateful that I’m able to be a working musician. In the near future, my goal is to release a lot of new material that I’ve been developing and finally send those songs out into the world. In the long term, it’s to just keep working on interesting projects and collaborating with talented, inspiring people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jvrjmvBF/Over-It-cover-smaller.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Over It cover smaller\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I grew up around music. My mom was largely self-taught on piano and guitar and wanted me to have the formal training she wasn’t able to have for herself, so I took classical piano lessons from around age 5. I started writing songs in the fifth grade, during my free time at school. Later in high school I got really into theatre, and after college I spent a number of years auditioning and doing shows while also gigging as a singer-songwriter. Eventually, the music part took over, though I still love theatre and enjoy combining those two art forms together when I compose for film.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It depends on the day, but usually some combination of writing, recording and teaching music.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, art is about the human experience, flawed and messy though it may be. If you’re removing that element, what’s the point? The writing and arranging of the music is the most fun part as far as I’m concerned, so outsourcing that to an algorithm is not at all appealing to me. Even when I’m stuck on a lyric or struggling to figure out some aspect of the music, I’d rather just wrestle with that or even collaborate with another human artist and see where that takes things. Art is about the process, not just an end product.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4TitSN1ZERVRAjzKPlnfQZ?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Over It” is about finding yourself in a challenging situation where you hope that a certain person in your life is going to rise to the occasion, but, for whatever reason, they just don’t have it in them. It’s about making peace with that and not letting the anger and disappointment consume you. It can be painful to let go of the idealized view you held of someone, but the truth is also empowering.</span></p>",

What does that partnership look like in practice?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driven Paper provides essential services for artists looking to elevate in their craft. Yes we assist artists looking to get major distribution but there's so much more involved.  The Team surrounding is a handful of goal getters with a common purpose and goal. We have Magazine writers, Festival Organizers, Stage Management, former music managers, Pr's, Dj's, event planners and entrepreneurs.  We actually care what happens to our artists and helping guide them in the right direction.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Festival coordination and professional stage management are major pillars of the brand. How does mastering the live side of music change an artist’s long-term trajectory?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely, once our artists are plugged in with us, We try to help facilitate their journey by way of interviews, shows, appearances and more.  We don't harvest studio only artists, we also help them with stage presence and help teach them the business. In the long run, we help get artists ready for the next step. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://audiomack.com//embed/dpcmovementsrecords/album/next-the-mixtape-driven-paper-next-level\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Next\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>With hands-on A&amp;R insight at the core of your approach, how do you identify artists who are ready to grow rather than just release music?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's all in their sound, confidence and how they carry themselves.</span></p>\n<p><strong>As the music landscape becomes increasingly digital, how does Driven Paper balance online growth with real-world presence and performance?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This team is literally Outside always interacting, networking and building relationships with influencers, media, artists and other creatives while maintaining a strong media presence. We are plugged to numerous key festivals and events to help push the culture forward. Artists connected to the brand receives great visibility by being apart of major events that keep pushing itself forward.</span></p>\n<p><strong>After a five-year hiatus, what ultimately called you back into the entertainment world and what had changed most within you during that time?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So this was like a movie, literally, at my day job I had been racially profiled working at Police headquarters in my city. This went so far that I was forced to shut down my record label and go back to regular life so to speak.  In the end, I was wrongly accused and was issued an apology, being charged with an attempted murder that never happened. Finally, I was awarded by the police a recognition award for my outstanding work with the individuals I work with awesome autistic, bipolar, schizophrenic and down syndrome aggressive adults. So after 5 years of sitting on the sidelines, I was done watching and not contributing to the scene so in September 2022 I made my return and decided to raise the bar even higher by getting involved in more community based events, aligning myself with Sony Music to facilitate distribution and starting writing for a magazine..many things to help out artists in the process. What changed was the scene, the new mentality and the new outlook when it came to working together. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/whjf0bVJ/Photo-Credit-Link-Prezzy.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Photo Credit Link Prezzy\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><strong>AI is changing how music is created, distributed, and even marketed. Do you see AI as a threat to independent artists or as the ultimate empowerment tool when used correctly?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be used creatively to be honest for many things but when we start hearing AI artists are signed to multi million dollar contracts and topping charts,we really need to look at the bigger picture and how we can at least meet at a common ground.</span></p>\n<p><strong>As streaming payouts continue to be debated, do you believe independence is becoming less about freedom and more about strategy?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's all calculated strategic moves now. You have a strong team surrounding you that facilitates visibility, continuous elevation and savage marketing team then best believe things will happen at a faster pace. Work smarter, not harder.</span></p>\n<p><strong>With AI capable of mimicking voices and styles, what becomes the artist’s most valuable asset moving forward?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I feel that artists with a real story and make music that hits home hard will always surpass the fluff, as I call it. AUTHENTICITY or GIMMICKS do work still to be honest but if you can stir up an authentic audience locally, regionally or nationally ,you will keep your fans engaged while growing new ones.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The hype about AI in music today is just so loud, as if all songs put out from now on will somehow be composed, recorded, or finalized by a computer. The headlines scream about the impending arrival of “the machine” for musicians. As if musicians are about to become unnecessary. It all does seem a bit sensational. But there does seem to be something quietly fascinating going on in 2026, something which has completely flown under the radar: people have begun listening again.<br><br>But before you assume this is just like every other “artists versus AI” discussion, consider what’s actually at stake. Nobody hates technology. Everyone loves tools, plugins, and software that help make music better. What they’re starting to reject is perfection. Perfection that is mathematically accurate, technically perfect, and devoid of any human flaws is no longer exciting. That’s boring. That’s safe. That’s like something that was recorded by an artist who has never struggled, failed, or taken a risk to get to a mic.<br><br>But human music, with all its minute timing variances, its \"broken\" vocals, its inconsistent phrasing, and unpredictable melodies, sounds as if it's alive. It sounds as if someone has actually lived it. The minute flaws are what give it character. They give it tension. They give it a reason to listen to it a second time. And that's something that no computer can ever reproduce. A computer can mimic a performance, but it can't live it. That's still the domain of the human musician.<br><br>The data is already beginning to show up in streaming metrics. Songs that can accept small flaws and irregular rhythms are better at retaining listener attention. They are getting more adds on playlists, more shares, and more heated discussion. Listeners are increasingly preferring music that takes risks and has feeling over music that is simply perfect in its mechanical execution.<br><br>So, what does this mean for musicians who are concerned about AI? Well, the tools are not the problem. The problem is in not remembering what makes you different. Your voice, phrasing, errors, and perspectives cannot be duplicated. These are the things you have over others, and in the year 2026, having an edge is a valuable thing once more.<br><br>The irony is that it is in its relentless pursuit of efficiency that AI may very well force musicians to remember what they are doing best. Those musicians who incorporate the human element in their work, allow it to breathe, and allow for its unpredictability in playing will find that audiences are once again taking notice. So, as a musician concerned about the threat of AI, here’s the truth: stop trying to be perfect. Don’t emulate a recipe. Create the music you would want to hear, the music with your story in it. Tools are just tools. The music isn’t about the tool—it’s about you. In a world where people seem more and more obsessed with perfecting their craft through artificial means, it’s the human factor that has become the key advantage. And in 2026, it’s been a long time since it’s been this strong.</p>",

Songs like Hole confront dementia with restraint, while World On Fire reflects uneasy modern realities. Known for BBC Introducing support and fearless collaboration, Stewart Macpherson arrives here focused and patient, delivering an album that values reflection, endurance, and emotional honesty over immediacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm currently focusing on the launch of my album. Being a self-released project, this is taking up a lot of time, but it should be worth the wait!</p>\n<p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding success, I feel like any day when someone discovers (and enjoys) what I do is a day to celebrate. Not the quantity, but the quality. My goal has always been to organically grow and discover places and people through music.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p>\n<p>I originally started in a band called Faith Healer when I was 15 years old. It's hard to believe that this was 35 years ago, but I was thown right into the deep end, so I learnt a lot from that experience. I then moved onto a few other bands before relocating to London, where I formed another group called We Were For. I also carried out various session work, which was a new experience that also helped me to further develop as an artist. I returned to Devon in 2012 and formed King Colobus with some old mates, but it always felt like a solo project with 3 other people, hence the reason why it ended up as a solo endeavour.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/36x14Zy1ZW2cq6r8DsSxuK?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p>\n<p>My typical day as an artist is pretty sporadic...I work as a kitchen designer by day and I have a family - not terribly 'rock n' roll', so I have to find pockets of time to focus on the music. There's a lot of material that one can absorb from day-to-day life and it helps inject reality into my musical content.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding AI, I don't think any of my material could have been created with it in the round, but I can see why some people use it as a tool. Whilst none of my music has been produced with it, I did use it for some artwork...I would have had to torch a village to get the front cover of the album and for obvious reasons, this was not an option!<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p>\n<p>'Torn Between Age &amp; Perseverance' is exactly what it says on the tin. Given my age, I have been dabbling with the idea of firing up the band again, but this is fraught with the challenges that life throws at all of us. It's an album about politics, religion, personal grief, insecurity and our inevitable ability to be self-distructive.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Plastic Orchestra have always been a band who are not afraid of motion. The music has always been the result of joyful propulsion, changes in rhythm, and the collective sense of wonder which has a conversation rather than a statement quality. With ‘Crick in the Neck,’ the Melbourne band takes a different turn. They ease up on the rhythm, expand the emotional palette, and even introduce the notion of space into the groove. The effect is the most intimate and disclosing song they have ever done.<br><br>Ultimately, Crick in the Neck is a song about care, and the price tag that comes with it. \"It’s about the sort of people who keep everyone else together,\" Stewart says, \"who listen before they speak, who solve everyone else’s problems, who take everyone else’s stress, who keep going when everyone else wants a rest.\" The band’s title for the track is a masterstroke of dry wit, taking a physical ache and transforming it into an emotional shorthand that everyone recognises. Crick in the Neck is a start of a conversation, rather than a start of a fireworks display.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" style=\"border-radius: 12px;\" data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1mjAkwqD3CVY4B5UqXRWy9?utm_source=generator\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>Musically, the song is a vibe rather than a push. It is a warm, relaxed beat that is funk- and R&amp;B-derived but in a way which is holistic, rather than courtesy of distinct imitation. The bass is deep in the pocket, led by the vision of leader Grace Snow, moving in a languid, eloquent way which provides the song's message. Drums are also confident in their swagger, swinging in a way which is relaxed, inviting the listener to breathe into rather than tighten up for a beat.<br><br>Guitars appear more as color than flash. The sound of them takes a nod at experimental sounds of the seventies, slightly askew and slightly playful. Guitars come in and out of focus without necessarily commanding attention but all the same managing to set mood. On this backdrop, there emerge and recede vocal harmonies of the female voice rising and falling along lines of a chant.</p>\n<p><br>These voices are less lead and harmony than they are concurrent thoughts, drifting briefly around the perimeter of an idea. It is an expression of the band’s philosophy as a unit. Plastic Orchestra is a collective that exists under Snow’s banner that is fueled by their love of sound itself. They have termed it an “excuse for playing with all of the music equipment that they own,” but Crick in the Neck proves that more than can be handled is not necessarily more. There is nothing here that doesn’t feel thought-out. There is an implicit confidence in the arrangement of this song, an understanding that it doesn’t need anything more than it has in order to be understood. What sets Crick in the Neck apart from other Plastic Orchestra tracks is not simply its speed but also its emotional slowness. The group refuses to tie up any loose ends.</p>",

Very little memorable music.</strong><br><br>Ironically enough, playlists never seem to amass a devoted following. Playlists produce listeners, but not necessarily fans.

What’s being asked instead of, “Is this track authentic?” “Is it complete?” is “Will it work on Spotify?” And when that question is in the room, creativity walks out.<br><br>This, of course, doesn't mean that playlists are pointless.

In this recent meme sensation taken from this April release, Hamm's character, the eagerly enthusiastic Andrew “Coop” Cooper, is fully absorbed into the beat, his eyes closed in rapture. On the internet, the meme writes itself:<br><br>However, the most fascinating thing here is not the meme.<br><br>It’s the song associated with it.<br><br>On both TikTok and Facebook, the clip is typically set to 'Turn the Lights Off' by Kato featuring Jon. The song is a 2010 club hit that has a disturbingly current emotional resonance. It originated as a club tune in Europe and has wittingly or unwittingly functioned as a time machine for tired Millennials and Gen Xers—a song that evokes a pre-burnout life of late nights and much-harder-earned freedom.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4ucEcizRM0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p><br><br>The surprising thing is that “Turn the Lights Off” is not even the song used in the actual series. *Your Friends and Neighbors* originally used “Sentient System” by Joseph William Morgan, a song from 2023, aptly capturing the modern feel for this series. Virality, however, affected all this. The social platforms decided on their soundtrack; this time, it captured the mood for the meme.<br><br>This is exactly how old songs are making a comeback in 2026.<br><br>Music no longer exists on a timeline. “A song could have languished for over a decade and suddenly sound even more relevant than one from last Friday.” Instead, it’s alignment and not timeline. When a song reflects a group’s emotion—exhaustion, freedom, happiness, longing—the natural process for the song to resurface occurs.<br><br>“Turn the Lights Off” is more than an anthem about club culture in this case—it’s an anthem about a lost sense of physicality. It’s about remembering when “music was something you inhabited, not something you scrolled past.”<br><br>This has profound implications for independent artists. This is further evidence that music is not a disposable medium. These back catalogs are living works that only wait for that moment to revive them. Context is as important as advertising. A TV moment, a meme, a joke shared about getting older.<br><br>As *Your Friends and Neighbours* prepares for the second season in April 2026, it is clear that the show will inevitably be forced to address the viral life after the scene. Culture has already done the legwork. \"Songs won't expire come 2026.\" They wait. And when the opportune time comes calling, they are seen dancing their way back to relevance. The lights are switched off, but their memories are still</p>",

Neither party has officially denied nor admitted to discussions taking place.<br><br>The prediction is published in a report called “Sutskever’s Fate, OpenAI’s Next Deal, A Hit Robot – and 13 Other Predictions for 2026” and was written by a news reporter named Ann Gehan. The report interprets the possible Pinterest deal as OpenAI’s aggressive move into e-commerce, visual discovery, and online advertising.<br><br><strong>Why Pinterest?</strong><br><br>On the face value, Pinterest appears to be a surprising candidate for a company that conducts research in AI. Nevertheless, from a strategic standpoint, it is a great fit.<br><br>It has a large set of cataloged images. This is based on the interest of the consumer – fashion, home decor, food, travel, and lifestyle. The platform is not based on the need for conversation or entertainment. This makes it a very valuable asset for AI commerce.<br><br></p>\n<p>The reported focus of OpenAI’s interest is on the following three key pillars:<br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The vast visual data resource that Pinterest has<br><br></li>\n<li>Its mature ad infrastructure<br><br></li>\n<li>Its long-term relationships with merchants and brands<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Collectively, these could greatly enhance the image/video generation capabilities of OpenAI, particularly as it increasingly faces stiff competition from Google, Meta, as well as Amazon within the AI-based e-commerce arena.<br><br><strong>Market Reacts Quickly</strong><br><br>Following the news, Pinterest shares were up 3% on Friday, as noted in Investing.com, indicating investors believe this is a real possibility. Pinterest is now worth about $17.5 billion, as shares trade at $25, close to where they were in early 2023.<br><br>It’s important to note that nearly two-thirds of voting power at Pinterest are held by co-founders Ben Silbermann and Paul Sciarra, so a takeover would necessitate collaboration between founders. Silbermann resigned as CEO around mid-2022 and left the company, but his influence still exists.<br><br><strong>Buy Rather Than Compete</strong><br><br>Conversational search, for instance, has been introduced by Pinterest using AI, making it a direct competitor against platforms such as ChatGPT. However, according to the report, there might be more value for OpenAI in acquiring rather than competing with Pinterest.<br><br>An acquisition could enable OpenAI to incorporate generative AI capabilities directly into visual search, recommendations, and advertising, turning Pinterest from a virtual mood board into a fully AI-driven discovery platform.<br><br><strong>What This Signals</strong><br><br>If the deal does come to fruition, this would represent a shift in the strategy at OpenAI, from a company that is a platform and a model supplier to one that is more of a consumer ecosystem player. Whether or not the deal ultimately takes place, the point is clear: the future battleground for AI has nothing to do with chat, and everything to do with the world of commerce, creativity, and visual discovery.</p>",
