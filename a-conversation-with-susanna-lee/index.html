Since 2021, he has been an active member of several editorial teams across Europe and the U.S., contributing to technology- and music-focused publications such as Indiefferential, microphone, and intheview.com. In June 2021, George joined Indiefferential Magazine, where he specializes exclusively in long-form interviews. Over the past year, he has conducted more than 2K interviews, speaking with artists, composers, designers, and athletes from around the world, often exploring the intersection of music, creativity, and personal narrative. Notable interviews include a conversation with award-winning composer Simone Benyacar, whose work spans major global campaigns such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible, Call of Duty, and Assassin’s Creed; George interviewed Anna Mészöly, fresh from winning the Best Performance (Best Actress) award in the Cineasti del Presente section at the 77th Locarno Film Festival, about her collaboration with Adrien Brody in A24’s The Brutalist. He has also interviewed Edouard Boulanger, co-driver for Audi and winner of Dakar 2021, as well as British illustrator and designer Andy Bourne, whose work draws inspiration from vintage comics, pop art, and 1960s psychedelia. He holds two Master’s degrees—in Special Education and Human Geography, Spatial Development, and Planning—as well as two Bachelor-level degrees in History and Ethnology and Computer Technology. His interdisciplinary academic background informs a human-centered approach to music journalism, focusing on storytelling, creative process, and the cultural contexts surrounding sound and art. His work focuses on storytelling, creative process, and the ways music and art reflect broader social realities.</div></div><div class="content__bar contentbar" id="js-content__bar"><div class="contentbar__inner"><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/whats-new-september-editions/" rel="prev"><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <span>Previous</span></a></div><div class="contentbar__share"><div class="contentbar__share-inner"><h3>Share:</h3></div></div><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/ben-rowleys-search-for-meaning-in-sound/" rel="prev"><span>Next </span><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></a></div><div class="contentbar__progress" id="js-contentbar__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div class="content__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6">You should also read:</h3><div class="cards content__related-cards"><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/julian-ransoms-triumphant-return-with-only-love-could-be-so-blind/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/369/responsive/whats-new-28-2xl-1-md.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="540" width="960" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/julian-ransoms-triumphant-return-with-only-love-could-be-so-blind/" class="invert">Julian Ransom&#x27;s Triumphant Return with &quot;Only Love Could Be So Blind&quot;</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2024-09-01T19:39">September 1, 2024</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/giant-killers-revisit-indie-pop-glory-with-new-single-around-the-blocks/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/368/responsive/whats-new-28-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/giant-killers-revisit-indie-pop-glory-with-new-single-around-the-blocks/" class="invert">Giant Killers Revisit Indie - Pop Glory with New Single ‘Around the Blocks’</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2024-08-31T17:48">August 31, 2024</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/andrew-levin-interview/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/365/responsive/whats-new-26-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/andrew-levin-interview/" class="invert">A conversation with Andrew Levin</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></div><time datetime="2024-08-10T03:54">August 10, 2024</time></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.svg" alt="Indiefferential" width="250" height="100"></a><div class="footer__copy"><p>© Indiefferential 2026</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Indiefferential" aria-label="Facebook" class="facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div></div></footer><div class="newsletter-popup" data-show-on-scroll="800px" data-show-after-time="5000ms"><div class="newsletter-popup__inner"><div class="newsletter-popup__right"><button class="btn white newsletter-popup__close">&times;</button><h3>Subscribe</h3><p>Get the latest news, updates and more delivered directly to your email inbox</p><input class="newsletter-popup__submit" type="submit" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" value="Subscribe"></div></div></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
