I’m currently recording my second full length EP which is set for release mid next year! Just over a week ago I released the latest single from that body of work, ‘When I Feel Like Giving Up’.</p><p><strong>What inspired the creation of “When I Feel Like Giving Up”?</strong></p><p>This tune started out as almost a kind of musical journal entry. I didn’t intend to include it on the album but the more I worked on and listened back to the song the more I felt like it deserved to be heard. I had been going through a hard time when I wrote that song, and reflecting on what my life was like when I was younger. Naive and carefree.</p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ibb.co/tb2j62S"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/cN8f98P/LANDSCAPE-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="LANDSCAPE-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw" border="0"></a></p><p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p><p>I’ve been apart of the music industry since I was 16. A working session musician from the age of 19 when I moved to Melbourne. However, I didn’t start doing my own thing and releasing music under The Terrifying Lows till end of 2018. I always wanted to be a songwriter and have my own solo project but was always tied up with other artists’ touring and recording schedules.</p><p><strong>What was the most challenging part of writing or producing this song?</strong></p><p>I think giving myself the space to be vulnerable and completely honest with myself and my audience is always the most challenging part of the process to me. Definitely the writing rather than the production. I love recording so much that any obstacles I encounter along the way are more like fun little side quests.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2odl8Ay49sxEdUJFJZzgNe?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p> </p><p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p><p>When I’m not working a typical day would start with some black coffee, exercise and then spending basically all day in my home studio. This is where I do the bulk of my writing and recording so whether I’m coming up with new ideas or chipping away at the next record, I spend a lot of time in this room.</p><p><strong>How has your sound evolved since your self-titled debut LP?</strong></p><p>I feel like I’m a project by project kind of guy. Crafting an overall sound for one body of work then moving onto the next. Definitely a lot less guitar focused in this new batch of songs. Moving away from Alt-Rock and just becoming more Alternative-Indie.</p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://ibb.co/XsyB0P4"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/J7xL6Td/PORTRAIT-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="PORTRAIT-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw" border="0"></a></p><p><strong>How do you reach new audiences? What advice or tips would you give to new artists?</strong></p><p>I still think performing is such a great way to reach a new audience. If people see you play an awesome live show then they’re going to pay attention. There’s also social media but I have the millennial disdain for it too. If I had to give any advice on social media it would be just do what you do and stay authentic. If you’re not the kinda person who is comfortable doing what everyone else is doing across the social media platforms then don’t do it. Find your own thing… people can tell when it’s not genuine. Don’t get bullied by your manager/ label reps to make dances on TikTok if that’s not your style.</p><p><strong>How do you translate the emotional intensity of your recordings to a live setting?</strong></p><p>I feel like the emotional intensity really increases at my live shows. Singing live is a less calculated exercise so I can deliver the lyrics in a freer and more emotional way. I always give space to my band to develop on the parts on the recording and add their own voice to the performances which helps a lot as well.</p><p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p><p>I think AI writes terrible lyrics so there’ll always be place for real human emotion and narratives. I see being a useful tool for somethings and the death of certain aspects of the music industry. Like jingle writing for example.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p><p>My latest single ‘When I Feel Like Giving Up’ is out now across all platforms! It’s the 4th single from my upcoming second LP. This song serves as a cathartic anthem for those navigating dark moments.</p><p>Photo Credit: The Terrifying Lows by Ian Laidlaw</p></div><footer class="content__inner content__footer"><div class="content__updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2024-12-21T16:52">December 21, 2024</time></div><div class="content__share"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Share this story:</h3><div class="content__share-inner"></div></div><div class="author"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/george-skendros-indiefferential-author.jpg" class="author__avatar" loading="lazy" alt="George S." height="1024" width="1024"><div class="author__info"><h3 class="h5 author__name"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></h3>George is a teacher, journalist, and interviewer based in Europe, with over six years of professional experience in education and cultural writing.
