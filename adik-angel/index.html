I then proceed with structuring and arranging the piece. It's crucial for me to ensure that each stage of production aligns with my artistic vision. Whether a creation comes together quickly or takes time, my focus is always on translating the sounds and ideas in my mind into reality. As a solo artist, I oversee every aspect of my music production, from composing melodies to mastering the final track.<br><br><strong>How do you approach the visual aspect of your music, particularly when creating accompanying videos?</strong><br><br>Since I have the opportunity to travel extensively, I have encountered many inspiring landscapes, atmospheres, and colors. I frequently capture these atmospheres in short videos. Often, I can immediately visualize which landscapes, settings, or atmospheres will complement my music and where these videos will fit precisely within the song and alongside which melody. Afterwards, it's a process of structuring and implementation.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vliJQwdy2Yw?si=OMpQPa3dLQ3NcLOZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vliJQwdy2Yw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a><br><br><strong>Are there any specific artists or musicians who have had a significant influence on your work?<br></strong><br>Yes, as a child, I listened extensively to classical music and particularly admired Mozart and later Bach. Their music must have trained my ear from a very young age.<br><br>As I started creating my own music, I delved into pop rock culture and hip-hop. I could mention several influences: Jean Michel Jarre in electronics, Phil Collins for his sound, Vangelis for atmospheres, French artists like Gold and Jean Jacques Goldman, and of course, in EDM: Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, and David Guetta. Additionally, Daft Punk and the Old School sounds, along with Michael Jackson (produced by Quincy Jones), have been significant inspirations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/RCpzFkF/Up-so-High-08.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Up-so-High-08" border="0"><br><br><br><strong>What do you consider to be your greatest achievement as a musician so far?</strong><br><br>This gift received to do the complete realization, from start to finish, of all the music that exists in my mind (albums and singles). This includes sounds, mixes, masters, and accompanying videos. I am really very grateful for this.<br><br>Additionally, all my collaborations have been highly enriching, as we learn a great deal from each other. And of course to have the opportunity to share my creations with my public.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDNivj2iqk4?si=4L3NsBk5Y6RUUZEp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><br><br><strong>What are your aspirations for the future of your music career?</strong><br><br><br>I aspire to continue evolving in my music career by exploring new sounds, creating new music, and discover new collaborations with diverse musicians.<br>And of course to share my creations with my audience, for which I am very grateful…</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3mKfidOIUdVHwVEEnI7p25?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br><strong>How did your time at the Geneva SAE and Lake Side Studio shape your approach to recording and production?</strong><br><br>During my time at both Geneva SAE and Lake Side Studio, I gained valuable experience as a production assistant. At SAE, I focused on technical aspects and learned various music production programs. At Lake Side Studio, I immersed myself in practical experience by witnessing different artists and bands, which was incredibly enriching for my approach to recording and production.<br><br><strong>What worked for you marketing-wise? What advice or tips would you give to new artists?<br></strong><br>Starting early with digital distribution and leveraging social networks helped me build an audience over the years. Patience is crucial, and celebrating every fan's feedback is significant. My advice to new artists is to stay authentic, avoid imitation, and let inspiration guide your music. Explore new ideas and trust your creative instincts, especially when handling all aspects of music production independently.<br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/9tg9CZF/Up-so-High-17.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Up-so-High-17" border="0"><br><br><strong>What are your goals? Where do you see yourself in five years?</strong></p><p><br>My main goal is to share my creations extensively with my audience and discover new artistic horizons. Predicting where I'll be in five years is challenging due to the evolving world dynamics, including the integration of AI across various life domains.<br><br><strong>What do you think about AI in music?</strong><br><br>I believe it's crucial for musicians to strike a balance between leveraging AI technology and infusing their own emotions and experiences into their music to truly connect with their audience.<br>While AI can bring significant benefits and aid in certain aspects, I think it's unfortunate to entirely relinquish the creative processes that are deeply human and imaginative. The human brain possesses immense creative capacities for these tasks, and it would be a loss to replace them with AI. AI is a tool designed to assist artists, not replace them.<br><br>However, AI can be valuable in expediting technical tasks, allowing artists more time for personal creative expression.<br><br>AI-driven writing tools can also play a role in marketing and promotion, but it's essential for artists to maintain their authenticity and personal touch to connect with fans on a deeper level. From a commercial standpoint, AI-generated music poses a threat to the livelihoods of creative artists. If streaming services prioritize cheaper AI-generated tracks over licensed music created by artists, composers risk losing a significant source of income, further challenging their careers.<br><br>We are undoubtedly on the cusp of a major revolution across all fronts, and it's uncertain whether it will solely progress in a positive direction. Personally, I believe that no matter how virtuosic, technically perfect, or remarkable AI-generated music may be, it lacks the "breath of life" — the divine spark of creation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/x2DNV10/Up-so-High-15-a.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Up-so-High-15-a" border="0"><br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong><br><br>I'm excited to announce the recent fresh release of the « On the Move - Remix » which showcases a more personal &amp; more Old School vibe.<br><br>I'm very grateful too for the opportunity to have produced the new music &amp; videos «  Up So High » from the Album : On the Move … despite challenges in promoting this Album due to unforeseen circumstances in 2020.
