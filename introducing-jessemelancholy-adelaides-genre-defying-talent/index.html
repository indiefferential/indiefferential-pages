With a DIY and a genre-blurring approach, he stands out as one of the most promising new talents in the independent music scene. But who exactly is JesseMelancholy, and how did he come to captivate audiences with his unique sound?</p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/QXzLW46/wings-cover-art.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="wings-cover-art" border="0"></p><p>JesseMelancholy isn't just a stage name; it's the embodiment of a singular creative vision. Unlike traditional bands with multiple members, Jesse handles every aspect of his music, from writing and producing to performing. His journey began in 2019, when he started experimenting with music in his bedroom. By 2022, he had honed his craft and began releasing music under the name JesseMelancholy, quickly gaining recognition for his innovative soundscapes.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2BjILT6i4bOvPeKPg7ATti?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>The music of JesseMelancholy is a melting pot of influences. Raised on a diet of pop legends like Michael Jackson and Adele, he was initially drawn to the infectious melodies and emotional depth of their work. However, as he grew older, his tastes evolved, and he began exploring more avant-garde artists. This eclectic mix includes the introspective lyrics of Roy Blair, the genre-bending styles of Brakence, the raw emotion of Phil Elverum, and the electronic beats of LCD Soundsystem. These diverse influences converge to form a sound that is both familiar and refreshingly unique, a blend of hyperpop, indie rock, and beyond.</p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/cgmGTTH/wings-press-image-2jpg.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="wings-press-image-2jpg" border="0"></p><p>photo by @rorzz__</p><p><br>While many artists rely on studio recordings to establish their presence, JesseMelancholy has also made a mark through live performances. He has played three notable shows across Australia, earning acclaim for his compelling stage presence. His live shows are not just performances; they're immersive experiences that capture the essence of his music. It’s no wonder he’s been dubbed the "hometown hero," a title that speaks volumes about his growing influence in the local music scene.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6t8P4EjFp5CRS7kueyIALA?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br>In addition to live performances, Jesse has been creative in his use of media. His latest single, "Wings," is accompanied by a music video that he edited himself using CapCut, a free video editing app. This DIY approach extends to every aspect of his work, underscoring his commitment to authenticity and artistic integrity.</p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/RQd2Qgq/wings-press-image-1.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="wings-press-image-1" border="0"></p><p>photo by @rorzz__</p><p>JesseMelancholy is on the verge of releasing his debut EP, "Does the Skin I Wear Define Me?" Scheduled for early October, the EP promises to be a sonic journey through Jesse's artistic psyche. The lead single, "Wings," serves as a tantalizing teaser for what's to come. The track is a masterpiece of genre fusion, blending the frenetic energy of hyperpop with the introspective lyricism of indie rock. It’s a song that tackles the complex emotions of supporting others while grappling with one's own struggles, making it both relatable and deeply personal.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/475d0mZmI0zOZHRKGWHZBH?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>The production of the EP was a labor of love. Working alongside co-producer Xenura, Jesse crafted the entire project in his bedroom studio. This intimate setting allowed him to experiment freely, resulting in a collection of tracks that are as innovative as they are emotionally resonant. The DIY nature of the production process also speaks to Jesse's versatility as an artist. Whether it's writing, producing, or editing music videos, he proves that you don't need a big budget to create impactful art.</p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessemelancholy/">Instagram</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><p class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on August 7, 2024</p><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div><div class="content__tag"><dt>Tags:</dt><dd><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tags/news/">News</a></dd></div></div><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" alt="Indiefferential"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="inverse" title="Indiefferential">Indiefferential</a></h3>Indiefferential team<p><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/why-does-spotify-keep-playing-the-same-songs/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/359/responsive/whats-new-15-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">Why Does Spotify Keep Playing the Same Songs?</h3></div></a></div><div class="content__nav__next"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/from-the-studio-to-the-stage-noam-peri-following-the-dream-in-la/" class="content__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="content__nav__text">Next Post<h3 class="h5">From the Studio to the Stage: Noam Peri Following the Dream in L.A.</h3></div><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/362/responsive/whats-new-22-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/introducing-magalie-vinotti/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/379/responsive/whats-new-1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/introducing-magalie-vinotti/" class="inverse">Introducing Magalie Vinotti: A Multilingual Powerhouse</a></h4><time datetime="2024-10-01T23:07">October 1, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/indiefferential"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7Gwd5X8/indiefferential-members.png" alt="indiefferential-members" border="0"></a></div></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/">Indiefferential</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Indiefferential 2025</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://indiefferential.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
