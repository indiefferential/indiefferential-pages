Get on the right playlist, and all is well. Streams will flow. Hits will roll in. Careers flourish. Champagne is likely popping.</p><blockquote><p>The reality of it is this: your track ends up on a playlist, plays a few thousand times for people who don’t know your name, and then.poof! into the cyber ether it vanishes, leaving you where you were when you began but refreshing your stats like a maniac.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not the playlists that are the problem. Playlists are great tools, sometimes astonishingly so. The end isn’t the playlists.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, artists were told that playlisting was something to be capitalized on as validation for artistry. As if the measure of success for a piece of music lay in its functionality between another piece hand.selected by an algorithm that fails to know or care who you are.<br><br><strong>And that’s when things begin to wobble.</strong><br><br>But with playlists as the goal, music itself will start to shift in shape. Songs will be shorter. Intros will be shorter. Choruses will come in sooner than is necessary. Risk will decrease. Texture will be reduced. Everything is designed to be readily pleasing, because that is what will be rewarded by the system.<br><br><strong>The payoff? Plenty of nice tunes. Very little memorable music.</strong><br><br>Ironically enough, playlists never seem to amass a devoted following. Playlists produce listeners, but not necessarily fans. Listeners will latch onto your song, give a cursory nod of the head in its regard, and then that’s it. There will be no narrative to be told, no context to provide for its meaning. You will only be a fleeting memory within their<br><br>Meanwhile, artists are spending months modifying their sound to be accepted into playlists that they will never be able to control and sometimes will never even be aware of when they are removed from them in the first place.<br><br>But there’s also a quieter cost. The pursuit of playlists causes artists to doubt their intuition. What’s being asked instead of, “Is this track authentic?” “Is it complete?” is “Will it work on Spotify?” And when that question is in the room, creativity walks out.<br><br>This, of course, doesn't mean that playlists are pointless. Playlists can serve to expose new listeners to new sounds. They can contribute to getting new releases out. And yes, they might alter a course of direction. However, they never had to be career-builders.</p><blockquote><p>"The artists who succeed tend to think about something else, such as the establishment of a recognizable sound, storytelling in relation to the work, the performance of gigs that convert audience members to believers, or the delivery of tracks that are complete rather than optimal."</p></blockquote><p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In short, ultimately people will follow artists and not playlists.</span><br><br>So, absolutely, enjoy the benefit that comes with it when it arrives. Enjoy the exposure you get with it. Just don’t build a career or a body of work around something created for background listening purposes.<br><br>“Make music that would still matter if playlists didn’t exist at all.” - Andrew Lipham, music producer and songwriter That, quietly, is where the real longevity is.</p></div><footer class="content__inner content__footer"><div class="content__updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2026-01-10T02:02">January 10, 2026</time></div><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Tagged in:</h3><ul class="content__tag-inner"><li><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tags/news/" class="invert">News</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Share this story:</h3><div class="content__share-inner"></div></div><div class="author"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/MacusHale.png" class="author__avatar" loading="lazy" alt="Mark Hale" height="543" width="622"><div class="author__info"><h3 class="h5 author__name"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/thierry-lecuyer/" class="invert" rel="author">Mark Hale</a></h3>Mark Hale is a writer, editor, and long-time cultural commentator specialising in guitars, music technology, and the quietly absurd world that surrounds them. He writes about instruments the way other people write about cars: with affection, irritation, and an unwavering belief that function matters more than mythology. Raised in a household where music was not a hobby but a constant presence, Hale grew up surrounded by vinyl records, half-functional amplifiers, and instruments that were always slightly out of tune. From an early age, he learned that guitars had personalities. Some were dependable. Some were brilliant but infuriating. Some looked magnificent and behaved like absolute idiots. This belief—that tools reveal character—has stayed with him and underpins his entire approach to writing. Before becoming a full-time writer, Hale spent years embedded in the unglamorous machinery of the music world. He worked in guitar shops where marketing promises collided daily with reality, learning very quickly which instruments survived real players and which existed purely for catalog photography. He loaded vans, wired pedalboards minutes before soundcheck, repaired cables with borrowed soldering irons, and watched outstanding musicians coax magic from battered gear while others struggled heroically with instruments that cost more than a small car.</div></div><div class="content__bar contentbar" id="js-content__bar"><div class="contentbar__inner"><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/why-old-songs-are-finding-new-life-in-2026/" rel="prev"><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <span>Previous</span></a></div><div class="contentbar__share"><div class="contentbar__share-inner"><h3>Share:</h3></div></div><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/plastic-orchestra-ease-the-pace-and-let-the-groove-breathe-on-crick-in-the-neck/" rel="prev"><span>Next </span><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></a></div><div class="contentbar__progress" id="js-contentbar__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div class="content__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6">You should also read:</h3><div class="cards content__related-cards"><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/why-2026-might-be-the-year-musicians-win-against-the-machines/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/487/responsive/indiefferential-magazine-5-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/why-2026-might-be-the-year-musicians-win-against-the-machines/" class="invert">Why 2026 Might Be the Year Musicians Win Against the Machines</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/thierry-lecuyer/" class="invert" rel="author">Mark Hale</a></div><time datetime="2026-01-12T23:47">January 12, 2026</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/spotify-lets-you-tell-it-what-to-play-inside-the-new-ai-powered-prompted-playlists-feature/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/472/responsive/indiefferential-magazine-5-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/spotify-lets-you-tell-it-what-to-play-inside-the-new-ai-powered-prompted-playlists-feature/" class="invert">Spotify Lets You Tell It What to Play: Inside the New AI-Powered “Prompted Playlists” Feature</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></div><time datetime="2025-12-21T21:37">December 21, 2025</time></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.svg" alt="Indiefferential" width="250" height="100"></a><div class="footer__copy"><p>© Indiefferential 2026</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Indiefferential" aria-label="Facebook" class="facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div></div></footer><div class="newsletter-popup" data-show-on-scroll="800px" data-show-after-time="5000ms"><div class="newsletter-popup__inner"><div class="newsletter-popup__right"><button class="btn white newsletter-popup__close">&times;</button><h3>Subscribe</h3><p>Get the latest news, updates and more delivered directly to your email inbox</p><input class="newsletter-popup__submit" type="submit" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" value="Subscribe"></div></div></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
