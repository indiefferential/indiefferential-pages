It drops on November 7th, and I’m putting all my energy into making sure it hits just right. I’m also spending time connecting with my fans online through TikTok and Instagram, planning some fun surprises leading up to the release and afterwards too! <br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal? </strong><br><br>For me, success is more about how my music resonates with people rather than just numbers. If my songs make someone feel understood or help them through something they’re experiencing, that’s a win. My goal is to keep creating music that speaks to people, keeps growing my fanbase, and eventually, I’d love to be performing at major festivals, connecting with fans in person. </p><p><br><strong><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/mX6N2bz/Copy-of-DSC07540.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Copy-of-DSC07540" border="0"></strong></p><p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist? </strong><br><br>I actually don’t have a typical day as an artist because music isn’t my full-time job—I’m also a full-time law student, so balancing both can be a challenge! With university just starting back up, when I dedicate a day to music, it’s usually spent in my home studio recording for hours. I focus on visualising what the song feels like and how I want to portray it, which is exactly what I’ve done for all three of my singles, and my upcoming release. As for writing, it’s kind of unpredictable—inspiration hits randomly, so I’m always writing in my spare moments, whenever and wherever the ideas come. <br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music? </strong><br><br>AI is fascinating, and I think it has a lot of potential to help artists in creative ways. Whether it’s generating ideas or even helping with the more technical side of things like production, it can be a great tool. But at the end of the day, music is about human emotion which is something I believe AI can’t fully replicate, if at all. It’s actually really scary to be seeing the level of emergence from AI in today’s society, in many ways but especially as a female in music, there are some things I’ve seen that are pretty alarming and at the hands of anyone with a device. </p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/f1Z5vd9/Copy-of-DSC07294.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Copy-of-DSC07294" border="0"></p><p><strong>With over 8,000 streams in just a week, your fanbase is clearly growing fast! Any advice for upcoming artists?</strong><br><br>Thank you! My advice would be to know that you’re allowed to feel inspired and use that inspiration in your art. As long as you’re making music with the intention to discover your own sound, the end result will always be yours! I see so many people hating on emerging artists like Nieve Ella, saying that she “wants to be Olivia Rodrigo” and I’m literally just like OH my God…people are allowed to sound similar to other artists without it being copying. Olivia also did not create the concept of shouting in Pop music, although she does it fantastically. Some people don’t like to see new faces entering the industry, but there are so many people who love to see it! Your music will reach the audience that’s right for you, and will love your songs. </p><p><strong>If you could describe your musical journey in a single lyric from one of your songs, which one would it be and why? </strong><br><br>It would be “Credibility I owe myself” from my song “Credibility.” This lyric perfectly sums up my journey because, as an independent artist balancing my music with being a full-time law student, I’ve had to build everything from the ground up. There’s this constant drive to prove to myself that I’m capable of achieving my goals, regardless of the challenges. It’s about recognising the hard work I’ve put in and giving myself credit for how far I’ve come. </p><p class="align-center"><br><br><strong><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5VWzWrMLxS8UkORd4VyzVC?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div></strong></p><p class="align-left"><strong>What’s your creative process like? </strong><br><br>It starts with a feeling, honestly. I’ll usually have a lyric pop into my head, and from there, I’ll build around it. Most times I start with a simple idea on my phone—and other times I’m in my home studio at like 2 in the morning, bouncing ideas back and forth. I love layering harmonies and experimenting with different tones as I write, I literally sing different random lyrics aloud as I write so I probably sound like a crazy person haha. Once the lyrics and melody are in place, I send it over to my producer Dan and he’ll go over it, and sometimes send me some feedback on what I could add to make it better. Once he begins the mixing &amp; mastering process, I focus on creating visuals that capture the mood of the track. </p><p class="cvGsUA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><strong><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">How do you see your sound evolving in the future?

I’ve also been drawn to synth-pop, kind of like The Weeknd vibes which bringing some of that in would be exciting. Other than that, I’d want my sound to evolve naturally, but I’m definitely open to blending genres.</span></p><p class="cvGsUA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><strong><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Tell us about the last EP or single you've discovered and listened to.

It’s such a powerful song, and as a Black female artist myself, I resonate so heavily with the message. The way they’ve touched on the struggles and realities we face is so endearing, and I would definitely go as far to say it’s one of the most brave songs I’ve heard in a long while; that prejudice isn’t something spoken about much in the music industry if it isn’t around someone like Beyoncé. It is very real, and many smaller artists face it. And musically, it’s just heavenly—their voices, the production, everything about it feels real and authentic. I would genuinely love t</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">o meet them or just talk to them one day.
