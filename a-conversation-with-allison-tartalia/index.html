I’m finishing up several of my own songs, with the intention of releasing an EP later this year. I’m also currently scoring a short film and producing some songs with my friend and singer-songwriter Alyson Greenfield.</span></p><p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, I just want to keep doing this as long as possible, and I’m grateful that I’m able to be a working musician. In the near future, my goal is to release a lot of new material that I’ve been developing and finally send those songs out into the world. In the long term, it’s to just keep working on interesting projects and collaborating with talented, inspiring people.</span></p><p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/jvrjmvBF/Over-It-cover-smaller.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Over It cover smaller" border="0"></p><p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up around music. My mom was largely self-taught on piano and guitar and wanted me to have the formal training she wasn’t able to have for herself, so I took classical piano lessons from around age 5. I started writing songs in the fifth grade, during my free time at school. Later in high school I got really into theatre, and after college I spent a number of years auditioning and doing shows while also gigging as a singer-songwriter. Eventually, the music part took over, though I still love theatre and enjoy combining those two art forms together when I compose for film.</span></p><p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends on the day, but usually some combination of writing, recording and teaching music.</span></p><p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, art is about the human experience, flawed and messy though it may be. If you’re removing that element, what’s the point? The writing and arranging of the music is the most fun part as far as I’m concerned, so outsourcing that to an algorithm is not at all appealing to me. Even when I’m stuck on a lyric or struggling to figure out some aspect of the music, I’d rather just wrestle with that or even collaborate with another human artist and see where that takes things. Art is about the process, not just an end product.</span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4TitSN1ZERVRAjzKPlnfQZ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over It” is about finding yourself in a challenging situation where you hope that a certain person in your life is going to rise to the occasion, but, for whatever reason, they just don’t have it in them. It’s about making peace with that and not letting the anger and disappointment consume you. It can be painful to let go of the idealized view you held of someone, but the truth is also empowering.</span></p></div><footer class="content__inner content__footer"><div class="content__updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2026-01-22T23:40">January 22, 2026</time></div><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Tagged in:</h3><ul class="content__tag-inner"><li><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tags/introducing/" class="invert">Interviews</a></li><li><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tags/news/" class="invert">News</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Share this story:</h3><div class="content__share-inner"></div></div><div class="author"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/george-skendros-indiefferential-author.jpg" class="author__avatar" loading="lazy" alt="George S." height="1024" width="1024"><div class="author__info"><h3 class="h5 author__name"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></h3>George is a teacher, journalist, and interviewer based in Europe, with over six years of professional experience in education and cultural writing. Since 2021, he has been an active member of several editorial teams across Europe and the U.S., contributing to technology- and music-focused publications such as Indiefferential, microphone, and intheview.com. In June 2021, George joined Indiefferential Magazine, where he specializes exclusively in long-form interviews. Over the past year, he has conducted more than 2K interviews, speaking with artists, composers, designers, and athletes from around the world, often exploring the intersection of music, creativity, and personal narrative. Notable interviews include a conversation with award-winning composer Simone Benyacar, whose work spans major global campaigns such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible, Call of Duty, and Assassin’s Creed; George interviewed Anna Mészöly, fresh from winning the Best Performance (Best Actress) award in the Cineasti del Presente section at the 77th Locarno Film Festival, about her collaboration with Adrien Brody in A24’s The Brutalist. He has also interviewed Edouard Boulanger, co-driver for Audi and winner of Dakar 2021, as well as British illustrator and designer Andy Bourne, whose work draws inspiration from vintage comics, pop art, and 1960s psychedelia. He holds two Master’s degrees—in Special Education and Human Geography, Spatial Development, and Planning—as well as two Bachelor-level degrees in History and Ethnology and Computer Technology. His interdisciplinary academic background informs a human-centered approach to music journalism, focusing on storytelling, creative process, and the cultural contexts surrounding sound and art. His work focuses on storytelling, creative process, and the ways music and art reflect broader social realities.</div></div><div class="content__bar contentbar" id="js-content__bar"><div class="contentbar__inner"><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/an-interview-with-link-prezzy-driven-paper/" rel="prev"><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <span>Previous</span></a></div><div class="contentbar__share"><div class="contentbar__share-inner"><h3>Share:</h3></div></div><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/why-bandcamp-banned-ai-music-and-what-it-means-for-artists-in-2026/" rel="prev"><span>Next </span><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></a></div><div class="contentbar__progress" id="js-contentbar__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div class="content__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6">You should also read:</h3><div class="cards content__related-cards"><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/an-interview-with-aevina/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/413/responsive/whats-new-3-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/an-interview-with-aevina/" class="invert">An interview with Ævina</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2025-10-21T22:59">October 21, 2025</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tillerman-a-transatlantic-collaboration/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/383/responsive/whats-new-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tillerman-a-transatlantic-collaboration/" class="invert">Tillerman: A Transatlantic Collaboration with Their New Single &quot;The Son Must Follow The Moon&quot;</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2024-10-02T00:21">October 2, 2024</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/remain-blank/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/380/responsive/448692402_447571941364036_5812885195031316918_n-md.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="324" width="576" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/remain-blank/" class="invert">REMAIN BLANK: Redefining Northern Grit with &quot;Plastic Hooligans&quot;</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2024-10-01T23:24">October 1, 2024</time></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.svg" alt="Indiefferential" width="250" height="100"></a><div class="footer__copy"><p>© Indiefferential 2026</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Indiefferential" aria-label="Facebook" class="facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div></div></footer><div class="newsletter-popup" data-show-on-scroll="800px" data-show-after-time="5000ms"><div class="newsletter-popup__inner"><div class="newsletter-popup__right"><button class="btn white newsletter-popup__close">&times;</button><h3>Subscribe</h3><p>Get the latest news, updates and more delivered directly to your email inbox</p><input class="newsletter-popup__submit" type="submit" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" value="Subscribe"></div></div></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
