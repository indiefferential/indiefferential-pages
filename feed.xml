                <p class="dropcap">Spotify is marking the beginning of a new era of musical recommendations by empowering users to create playlists of their own choice simply by writing down what they want to listen to. Spotify, known to constantly come up with some innovative solution, presents to users another amazing product called “Prompted Playlists” that use artificial intelligence to create playlists based on the music idea users want to listen to.<br><br>"Until now, Spotify's algorithmic recommendations, such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar, operated in the background, shaping what millions of users around the world heard every day. But with the new feature, instead of just letting the algorithm try to decipher what you like and no one else, you can now tell it what you want, using natural language, like "I'd like upbeat indie songs to listen to on a rainy commute" and "Start with energizing pop and hip-hop songs to run to and calm-down sounds after a workout," and it will scour your entire listening history, as well as your recent activity, to curate a playlist based on what you specify and what your musical path has taken you on, based on what you like and what you've liked before."<br><br>The new feature rolled out its beta version on December 11th, 2025, and it is only available to Spotify Premium users in New Zealand, which is the first country Spotify has targeted prior to the universal rollout.<br><br><strong>The Difference about Prompted Playlists Compared to Previous Solutions </strong></p>
<p><br>The key thing that distinguishes the latest playlists as a solution compared to the technology available before it has to do with the level of detail that the consumers are given the freedom to insert into their requests. As opposed to the required details being such broad parameters as “sport” or “relax,” the consumers are able to insert parameters such as genres, periods, mood, rates, and even cultural movements.<br>Spotify</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each playlist that could be created with that prompt comes with an explanation of how songs were selected, which provides the user with insight into the logic the system used to decide which songs to pick in response to the user's query and listening habits, which, according to Spotify, allows it to be a more personalized experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>The company has also provided starting examples for those who are having trouble thinking of their own, such as combinations based off of famous tours and songs that match a certain mood.<br><br>The executives at Spotify describe “Prompted Playlists” as an incarnation of a new approach to music discovery that de-emphasizes predictiveness and leans toward an interactive process whereby the user has a direct input into what they listen to. “This is the first feature that puts control of the algorithm and the overall Spotify experience directly in your hands,” said the company, as they described an aspiration to make music discovery an “intentional,” “responsive,” and “contextual” process.<br><br><br>This offering follows on the back of experimentation involving AI-assisted playlisting tools, such as the AI Playlist product that Spotify trialed in countries such as the U.K. and Australia back in 2024 but with the new tool called Prompted Playlists adding more depth to the personalization elements and how AI responds to music-related prompts. As Spotify continues to develop and enhance their AI tools, Prompted Playlists suggests a future where a user can literally verbalize their dream playlist, and it will come to life, all within the same application. However, based on how successful the beta experience has been in New Zealand, this may be about to change what a music playlist means in a world of streaming.</p>

                <p>Near enough to two decades, Wildstreet have kept afloat a style of hard rock that holds firm on volume, melody, and raw honesty. Born from the sprawl of New York City, a totally dysfunctional metropolis, Wildstreet have never backed down from a trend, let alone toned down what they are for a more palatable mainstream lexicon. What appears on the surface to be a return of a long-dormant force with a new single, Ill Follow, no wait, with a new single When Its Gone coming out this winter is something far more of a reaffirmation of what theyve always been about.<br><br>When Its Gone marks the first time the current lineup of Wildstreet has been captured on record, and each detail of it brings that notion of arrival with it. "When Its Gone" presents a balladic sense from the off, giving the space to breathe around the more emotive aspects before gradually opening up into something sprawling and confident. It's a pure arena rock ballad, through and through, and it's one that comes from a sense of restraint and a lack of fanfare. The guitars build and swell rather than crash and scream, the drums are confident and authoritative but never showy or excess-filled, and the vocals are right up front and center and reflect a sense of contemplation that feels wholly earned. There's no sense of nostalgia for its own sake here. There's a band peering back that takes only a moment to grasp where it is now.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/5pttBZUGPhF7AcVgDke02r?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p>The frontman, Eric Jayk, has been the sonic cornerstone of Wildstreet all along, and it's especially evident in the band's new work. The song, written in conjunction with Todd Long, started as a basic demo track that was then reworked in production to reflect the artistic vision of the band members. The result aims to recall the essence of their initial debut in 2009, coupled with the energy of the band's present lineup.<br>It's the juxtaposition that drives the meaning in 'When It's Gone.' It's a sound that's unmistakable yet not dated in the process, nor overly polished to the point of standing in opposition to what makes it interesting.<br><br>Recording itself is a testament to Wildstreet’s authenticity. "Recording the band's drums was done in New York City at Virtue and Vice Studios, giving the song a tangible quality—something you can feel as much as hear." The drummer, Dylan David, is deliberate and powerful, keeping the song grounded while also allowing it to breathe on its own terms. "Producer and frequent collaborator Kyle Kelso was on hand to provide editing and mixing, as well as songwriting, with a sure touch that keeps the song's earthy qualities in mind," keeping a full and rich quality in the song, with plenty of room for all of the instruments to shine through.<br><br>The history of Wildstreet also helps to put this situation into perspective. With all sorts of acts, from hard rock veterans to outsiders, they have built up a core group of fans through their non-stop touring schedule and refusal to compromise their sound. This year alone, they have appeared with legends on the Monsters of Rock Cruise, and their music has been featured on the Peacemaker series on HBO Max. While recording in every corner of the globe, they somehow managed to keep themselves together, and this is reflected in this release.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/jkyZkDcB/prod-track-files-1477210-extra-pictures-Wildstreet-1.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="prod track files 1477210 extra pictures Wildstreet (1)" border="0"></p>
<p><br><br>Thus, the moment and the scale of “When Its Gone” are what give this music resonance, but it is the sincerity that gives this music real power. There is nothing fancy occurring in these lyrics, simply exploration of absence, consequence, and the acknowledgment of what is often too late to realize. “Jayk sings these lyrics without fanfare, as though trusting in the ability of this music to achieve whatever it is supposed to do. Guitar solos erupt with purpose—to rock, but without indulgence.” As Wildstreet readies for tour dates in Canada, an anniversary tour in Europe, and additional recording sessions, "When Its Gone" feels like a turning point. It marks the end of one era and the beginning of another, a reminder as to why this particular group of musicians has been around so long. Wildstreet has no use for reinvention as a form of spectacle. Wildstreet has a passion for music that lasts, a passion for live performances, a passion for recording that feels alive. Within a world of hard rock that often rests upon either the overly polished or the overtly nostalgic, Wildstreet find themselves in a true middle ground. Where "It’s Gone" proves that the size of an arena sound can still equate to a sense of the personal, and experience, when combined with conviction, remains rock music at its best.</p>

                <p class="dropcap" data-start="490" data-end="917">In the dusty corners of practice spaces and the attic stacks of vintage hunters, a humble piece of guitar history sits quietly waiting to be rediscovered: the <strong data-start="649" data-end="683">Marlboro solid state amplifier</strong>. These amps, inexpensive, unflashy, and often overlooked, were staples of the late 1970s and early 1980s, offering players a reliable way to turn up without the price tag of high-end tube gear.</p>
<p data-start="966" data-end="1503">Unlike tube amplifiers that have dominated guitar lore, Marlboro amps were built around <strong data-start="1054" data-end="1079">solid state circuitry</strong>, which uses transistors instead of vacuum tubes. Solid state designs were cheaper, more robust, and easier to maintain,ideal for beginners and budget-minded players. Marlboro Sound Works, a brand associated with the <strong data-start="1298" data-end="1343">Musical Instrument Corporation of America</strong> in Syosset, New York, distributed these amplifiers during their heyday, often via catalog retailers like Montgomery Ward.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="966" data-end="1503"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/d0Z4WBCs/image.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="image" border="0"></p>
<p data-start="1505" data-end="1824">Models ranged from small practice units to larger combo amps. The <strong data-start="1571" data-end="1578">20A</strong>, for instance, was a 10-watt solid state practice amp with an 8″ speaker, while the <strong data-start="1663" data-end="1671">132A</strong> and <strong data-start="1676" data-end="1685">G-40R</strong> offered more power and added features like reverb, EQ controls, and multiple inputs for versatility. <a href="https://marlboroamplifiers.blogspot.com/2015/05/marlboro-132a-amplifier.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="https://marlboroamplifiers.blogspot.com/2015/05/marlboro-132a-amplifier.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]!"></a></p>
<p data-start="1868" data-end="2223">So what did these amps <em data-start="1891" data-end="1898">sound</em> like? In their era, Marlboro solid state units delivered a clean, straightforward tone that was warm and clear enough for practice and small gigs. Some models featured onboard effects like tremolo or reverb and even external speaker outputs — quite advanced for budget gear at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-start="1868" data-end="2223">One of the biggest modern appeals of old Marlboro amps is how well they pair with <strong data-start="2275" data-end="2293">effects pedals</strong>. Fuzz, overdrive, chorus, and delay all sit comfortably on top of the amp’s neutral foundation, making Marlboro combos ideal pedal platforms. In an era where many players rely on pedals to sculpt their sound, these amps have quietly found a second life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="3253" data-end="3624">Another reason Marlboro amps endure is their construction. These units were built simply and sturdily, which has made them favorites among DIY enthusiasts. Some owners swap speakers, recap aging components, or modify EQ sections to coax new sounds from old circuitry. Others prefer to leave them untouched, embracing every hum, hiss, and quirk as part of the amp’s story.</p>
<p data-start="3626" data-end="3831">Despite their growing appreciation, Marlboro solid state amps remain relatively affordable on the vintage market. That accessibility mirrors their original purpose, tools for musicians, not museum pieces.</p>
<h3 data-start="3833" data-end="3863">Why Marlboro Still Matters</h3>
<p data-start="3865" data-end="4185">Marlboro amps may never headline a gear collector’s wish list, but that’s precisely why they matter. They represent a time when music gear was about <strong data-start="4014" data-end="4036">function, not hype</strong>. They lived in garages, rehearsal spaces, and first apartments. They amplified beginner riffs, punk rehearsals, and late-night songwriting sessions.</p>
<p data-start="4187" data-end="4543">Today, rediscovering a Marlboro solid state amp feels like uncovering a forgotten chapter of musical history, one where tone was earned, budgets were tight, and creativity mattered more than brand names.

                <p>But in 2025, the most worrying thing for music lovers was not the price of concert tickets or sold-out tours, but deception. According to a new report, hackers and fraud networks have managed to steal a staggering $5.3 billion from music fans this year by masquerading as some of the most popular artists in the world, making stardom a tool of deception and social media a landmine.<br><br>The results, published by social media security firm Spikerz, show a vast network of AI scams at work on various platforms such as X, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. The scams, becoming more sophisticated each day and hardly distinguishable from actual artist communications, relied on fake accounts, AI voices, doctored photos, and cloned branding to deceive fans into purchasing nonexistent merchandise, bogus concert tickets, or so-called “fan experiences” that never actually existed.<br><br>But at the heart of the fray were the biggest names in pop. Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter were named as the two most impersonated artists of the year – a measure not only of their popularity, but of the extent to which their fan bases are integrated into the fabric of the internet. They were followed by Billie Eilish, BTS, Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, BLACKPINK, Ariana Grande, and Drake, completing a top ten that looks like a world streaming chart – and a dream list for a scammer.<br><br>However, what makes this scamming wave particularly ominous is its ability to sound so legit. The AI technology has developed to the extent that fake artist accounts now post with very realistic captions, visuals, as well as simulated speech patterns that resemble the artists themselves. To fans, particularly the younger or more devoted ones, the difference between the real accounts and the fake ones has never been more difficult to distinguish.<br><br>As Spikerz consultant Scott Cohen explained, these social platforms are both the most powerful and most vulnerable bridge for artists and audiences. These are the platforms where fans mainly look for announcements, drops, and interaction, which becomes the main territory for exploitation. If artists are expected to innovate, connect, and develop communities online, then these platforms must safeguard them from continuous digital attacks, explained Cohen.<br><br>The harm extends well beyond a loss of funds to individual fans. When a scam occurs via a fake artist account, the loss of funds is merely the tip of the iceberg. Artists lose reputation, fan trust, and ultimately brand as a result of these scams that impact future ticket sales, merchandise releases, sponsorships, and record label partnerships. In an increasingly fan-focused music economy, the loss of trust is crippling.<br><br>And this isn’t a new issue — it’s simply escalating at an exponential rate. It has become all too common for well-known artists to be pulled into scam patterns that they themselves had no control over. For example, fans of Arctic Monkeys were scammed when a group of fraudsters acted as the band’s booking agent and promoted a fake world tour for 2025. Oasis fans got caught up during the mayhem of the band’s reunion ticket sales, with the average victim losing £346; and a banking report later confirmed that 90 percent of these scams came from phony ads on social media sites.<br><br>Even well-established pop stars have been affected. Sophie Ellis-Bextor issued a warning to her fans when her hit “Murder On The Dancefloor” was used in a scam advert generated by AI. Earlier last summer, Facebook came under fire for its inability to stop fraudulent Eras Tour ticket scams connected with Taylor Swift.<br><br>But what’s been different in 2025 is the scale. The technology has enabled scammers to industrialize their deception, generating thousands of fake accounts, posts, and ads simultaneously — all of which are crafted to look native to the platform and emotionally compelling. This isn’t spam anymore; this is a carefully crafted trap that seeks to leverage excitement, urgency, and fan loyalty. The catch is that the more artists reach out to their audience through the internet, the more vulnerable the audience becomes. And until the platforms take concrete measures to ensure verification and removal of content, the fans are left with a world where even your favorite artist may not be who they claim to be. By 2025, pop music had become far more than a cultural phenomenon. It had also become one of the most profitable methods of cybercrime. But for millions of fans, the price of faith was heartbreak — and billions of dollars lost.</p>

                <p>Oasis fans may have to put their bucket hats and parka jackets away for a bit longer because Liam Gallagher has come out with an official announcement that the Britpop legends will not be gracing the stage until 2027. It was a year of reunions and 41 successful performances, but all that speculating about what the future holds is momentarily put on hold because of this reality check from the one man who can deliver it.<br><br>The news came in a succession of posts on X (Twitter), with fans rallying the frontman for information about tour dates in 2026, Knebworth speculations, and whether or not Oasis were indeed lining up another monumental comeback. Liam's response was simple: an outright, unrepentant no. Asked to make announcements regarding 2026 dates, he simply said: “We’re not doing anything in 2026 sorry.” Further questioning about Knebworth — speculated to be a virtual certainty with bookies about a comeback — was summarily dismissed: “ITS NOT HAPPENING.” In one instance, he even threw in the net result of a cheeky shrug: “I don’t [have] snizzle to do until 2027 I mean happy Christmas.”<br><br>The hiatus comes after the band’s monster ‘Live ’25’ reunion tour, which concluded in Brazil on November 24 following 41 shows that rekindled the passion of the original fans and brought an entirely new following into the fold. The tour was a cultural touchstone, a point of joint nostalgia and renewal that spanned continents. When the final show concluded, a statement from the band was both beautiful and mysterious, as they quoted an excerpt from a piece by journalist Simon Price that had previously labeled them “the most damaging pop cultural force in recent British history,” hailing instead “love, joy, tears, and euphoria” that poured into every stadium around the globe. And then came the phrase that sparked a thousand theories: “There will now be a pause for a period of reflection.”<br><br>And reflect, it seems, that everyone did. Rumors of further live dates, especially the long-rumored return to Knebworth, surfaced with all the speed of Oasis rock riffs. The rumors took on even greater fuel when Liam began taunting, “I know things you don’t know,” prompting a frenzy of activity among fans — and again when he told the faithful at their final Wembley show, “See you next year,” an exchange that, as he has since admitted, brought him “a few tuts and raised eyebrows.” Even officials of the British government found themselves swept up in the rumor vortex, as Lady Taylor of Stevenage announced in October from the floor of the House of Lords that Knebworth House would be hosting five days of Oasis concerts in July of next year — a claim she quickly disavowed when it made headlines.<br><br>But for now, all indicators are pointing to a quiet. Or at least, an Oasis-level quiet, which means that Liam will still send out cryptic tweets, Noel will still deny everything, and the fans will still put their money on possible venues, setlists, and new music. But all indications are that 2026 is a no-go.<br><br>Still, if history has taught us anything, it’s that Oasis never does anything small — or predictable. A pause could mean rest, recalibration, behind-the-scenes negotiations, or the build-up to something even bigger. This, remember, is the same band that came back after 15 years and sold out stadiums around the globe. Until then, Oasis mania remains on the backburner, rumors stay alive, and 2027 is looming in the horizon, which could possibly be the next chapter in this rock ‘n’ roll saga of reunions.</p>

        <title>Taylor Swift Won’t “Go Away”: Inside the Pop Icon’s Defiant Stand Against Critics</title>

                <p>Taylor Swift has never been averse to media attention, but towards the end of 2025, she finds herself in the midst of a phenomenon unlike any other — and all because of her prominence in the industry. Taylor appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 10th when she addressed an increasingly popular sentiment circulating through select pockets of the internet: the idea that it was high time for her to give someone else a turn and let the culture talk about her legacy as something behind her. Swift, with characteristic poise and brutal candor, offered only one word on the subject: “I don’t want to.”<br><br>It was not joking. It was a philosophy. Swift went on to say that what she loves most – in art, in love, in life – is longevity. Stick-with-it-ness. The capacity to continue to nurture something good when the rest of the world has long since moved on. With a body of work that has been defined by makeovers, cover-ups, and record-breaking tours, Swift positioned her own stick-with-it-ness not as dominance, but as dedication—to the art, to the fans, and to the kind of longevity that she has long admired in her hero Stevie Nicks. This message came across as empowerment to Swift's fans and defiance to her critics. And both were true.<br><br>But her late-night appearance was in the midst of a moment when criticism was not a concern, least of all. In the weeks around her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, Swift found herself the subject of a strange, orchestrated attack seeking to connect her artistic output to Nazi icons and dog whistles for the far right – a charge both ridiculous and damaging. Analysis provided by a behavioral intelligence tool uncovered thousands of posts from accounts likely to be inauthentic or bot-like, promoting conspiracy theories at the fringes of society into broad daylight. A lightning bolt necklace was declared propaganda masquerading as jewelry. A single line in a song with the word “savage” in it had been ripped from context. Not even her romance with Travis Kelce, a tabloid obsession for more than a year, remained off-limits, pressed into service to demonize her as a secret operative of “trad” culture and right-wing ideology. Fans defending her had the unfortunate effect of spreading their passions – and thus the posts online.<br><br>And yet, amidst all this, Swift has pressed on. December has also seen the release of the trailer for The Eras Tour: The Final Show, a concert film that records the final, emotional night of her historic world tour, held in Vancouver. It is released just in time for Apple’s Disney+ docuseries The End of an Era, which is about to give the public a glimpse of the more vulnerable side of the legend herself, including her response to a terrorism plot aimed at her concert in Vienna, and the catastrophic attack at a Taylor-themed dance night in Southport. These are dark moments that remind us that fame often hides the fact that even the biggest star in the world has real fears, and real grief.<br><br>Nevertheless, in spite of all the trauma, controversy, and incessant chatter about her supposed cultural ubiquity, Swift persists. It is almost as if this is precisely the problem with her critics – it is not only that she has not disappeared but that she also insists on not disappearing, on not playing the part of the aging or overexposed woman in pop who chooses to retire from view. No, she is doubling down instead. In an attention economy where peak visibility and sharp decline are the prizes, Taylor Swift has decided to endure. Not via nostalgia, or disappearance, but endurance. The latest take — direct, impassive, and deceptively straightforward — reads less as the latest act than as the thesis statement of her whole oeuvre. She’s not going anywhere. And she doesn’t want to.</p>

        <title>“Guaranteed Human”:  A Firm Stance by iHeartRadio Against AI-Generated Music</title>

                <p>In a daring and significance-laden move, iHeartRadio has announced a profound new policy that flatly prohibits AI-composed music, AI-developed on-air personalities, and synthesized voices from appearing on any of its radio stations or podcasts. Dubbed “Guaranteed Human,” the campaign represents a direct reaction to increasing concerns among listeners regarding the incursion of artificial intelligence into media areas of creativity and emotional expression.<br><br>The move comes at a time of explosive development in the realm of content generated by AI: Today, AI software is capable of churning out millions of songs every day—which sound remarkably similar to music composed by human beings. Naturally, this development has sparked more questions about creativity and authenticity for listeners and media executives alike than anyone might have anticipated.<br><br><strong>A Broadcasting Giant Says “No” to Synthetic Sound</strong><br><br>In an internal memo circulated among employees in late November 2025, Tom Poleman, Chief Programming Officer and President of National Programming at iHeartRadio, made the company’s position very clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be no use of AI-generated voices on the air.<br><br>There will be no AI-generated songs featuring virtual vocalists.<br><br>There will be no hosting of programs, segments, or “call-ins” by AI personalities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>This policy applies to the entire broadcast radio platform of over 850 stations in the global iHeart media network and its expanding podcast offerings.<br><br><br><strong>Why Now? The Stakes of AI in Audio Culture </strong><strong>Magazine</strong><br><br>The “Guaranteed Human” campaign is preceded by a growing debate in the media and music world about:<br><br><strong>AI music proliferation – </strong>Artificial intelligence music is flooding major streaming sites, with some topping the charts. This has raised questions about authenticity and competition from human artists.<br><br><strong>Listener sentiment -</strong> According to a study by iHeart, listeners prefer the authenticity of human content and are uneasy about AI substituting human creators—a shift in policy that the company attributes to this trend.<br><br><strong>Industry tensions - </strong>While iHeart is setting a clear boundary between AI and listeners, the industry as a whole (particularly streaming platforms) has been accepting of AI content as long as it does not masquerade as a real artist. This sets a difference in how media companies are deciding to integrate with the AI revolution.<br><br>However, according to certain sectors in the industry, AI could cause an “overcrowding” of low-effort songs among human artists. There are also those who are concerned about copyright infringement, job displacement, and even the lowering of creative standards.<br><br><br>What "Guaranteed Human" Really Means<br><br>Although its rhetoric is biting, the policy does exhibit nuance with regards to certain types of AI:<br><br><strong>However, iHeart could continue to utilize AI technology in the background for tasks such as scheduling, analytics, editing, and workflow automation—but not as on-air personalities or creative artists.</strong><br><br>The ban is specifically directed at synthetic vocalists and personalities that have been developed to imitate humans on the listener side. zipfm.net Stations are also incorporating the “Guaranteed Human” brand identity into their hourly station identification and imaging, reinforcing the promise of real people with every broadcast. zipfm.net Reactions from Audiences and the Industry The audience response has been mixed but passionately expressed: Most fans welcome this decision, as it is viewed as an affirmation of true artistic expression and a rejection of algorithmic "synthetic sludge" pushed by streaming platforms. The Daily Dot Critics wonder whether such a ban could eventually have an impact on discoverability, or even competitiveness, if rival platforms were to move more fully into AI-driven content. However, some observers in this industry point out the paradox of this large media outlet promoting human voices while developing internal systems using AI. InsideAudioMarketing A Cultural Flashpoint: What This Means for the Future The move by iHeartRadio is much more than a corporate decision—it is a reflection of the importance of human creativity in this new age of generative technology. In choosing to focus on the human voice, iHeartRadio is making a statement about its brand’s importance in this new era of convenience that values authenticity as well. Whether other media behemoths will follow suit, whether this position will become a liability or an advantage, only time will tell. But for now, it seems that iHeart has made its position clear: where the airwaves are concerned, there are some things that AI should never replace.</p>
