<p class="cvGsUA direction-ltr para-style-body align-center"><strong>ABOUT MONSTERS Unleash the Haunting Intensity of "Suffocate"</strong></p>
<p>German metal/post-hardcore outfit ABOUT MONSTERS return with Suffocate, their latest single under Redfield Records. A brooding and relentless track, Suffocate delves into the harrowing grip of toxic relationships—where manipulation, emotional detachment, and suffocating pressure slowly erode one’s sense of self.<br><br>Crafted by guitarist Florian Brunemann and vocalist Madeleine ‘Maddy’ Wiebe, with additional contributions from Julian Breucker (Smash Into Pieces, Future Palace, Annisokay, Beyond The Black), the single thrives on a fusion of crushing riffs, searing vocals, and an unshakable chorus.

                <p>Released September 5th, Copenhagen's own HalfcutLemon returns this month with their third track, "Disturbance," laying the groundwork for their forthcoming album coming late in the month. Reflecting on the odd, occasionally funny complexity of modern life, the band keeps pushing limits with their unique mix of raw punk looks, cinematic soundscapes, and lyrical introspection.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/Kjt6DhgG/5.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="5" border="0"> </p>
<p>First hearing reveals Disturbance as enigmatic and whimsical. Like a radio show interrupted by inquisitive catchphrases, quirky repetitions, and abrupt mood changes, the song develops. Still under the surface is something more cutting: a little critique on how our ideas, relationships, and even comfort are shaped by technology, social expectations, and even conspiracy culture. With a combination of restraint and reassurance, HalfcutLemon approaches these topics, lightly reminding us that, at the very least, "radiators unite" to keep us warm.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/casGkrzjwD8" title="HalfCutLemon - Disturbance" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="align-center">Musically, the single highlights HalfcutLemon's capacity to meld experimental textures with powerful beats. Peter Peter, a long-time friend, provides dramatic synths with an otherworldly depth; Persille Ingerslev adds choir layers and second harmonies to give the piece an almost hallowed quality. More vocals from Flemming strengthen the communal tone of the song and confirm its messages of direction and connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outcome is a song alternating between mantra-like repetition and vivid, fragmented imagery, always anchored by a consistent, hypnotic pulse. Mirroring the track's surrealism, the included video, now on YouTube,mixes mysterious pictures with familiar and warm moments. It challenges the audience to think, grin, maybe even take solace in the ridiculousness around them, much as the song does.</p>

<p>Another accomplishment for HalfcutLemon, a band slowly claiming their own territory inside Denmark's alternative rock scene, is this release. Built around a shared passion of emotionally charged songwriting, the band has incorporated post-punk, experimental, and cinematic inspirations to create a sound that is both original and powerfully relevant.</p>
<p>Recorded and created at Sweet Silence Studio with iconic Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen, their next album will highlight their development via partnerships spanning the underground scene and film music scene of Denmark.</p>
<p>From September 5th, disturbance will be available on all streaming services, providing listeners a preview of the audacious, immersive voyage HalfcutLemon are planning to reveal with their next full-length album.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing for a music festival looks very different when three children under the age of seven are running around your feet. What once was about choosing outfits and making playlists now starts months in advance with the search for babysitters. Eventually, we were lucky enough to have a dream team—grandfather, grandmother, and aunt—all coming together to care for our kids. With that reassurance, my wife and I could finally look forward to a rare weekend just for ourselves at Flow Festival.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-0rPEA49-Q" title="Flow Festival 2025 Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Getting ready for the festival began at my in-laws’ house. We had arranged for the children to spend the night there while we stayed at a friend’s place closer to the festival grounds. As we packed our backpacks, my father-in-law assumed my wife was just heading out for a photography gig. When we corrected him—no, we were both heading to Flow Festival for two full nights—his first reaction was disbelief: <em>“But you’ll still come back to put the kids to bed, right?”</em> After clarifying the plan, everyone relaxed, and the kids stayed happily behind, spoiled with treats and games at their grandparents’ home.</p>
<p>Another factor that makes the festival experience feel extra charged these days is that in Tanzania, where we live, there are hardly any similar festivals, nor much alternative live music. There is plenty of wonderful jazz, traditional music, and DJ-based music, but it felt refreshing to wander among tens of thousands of people <em>just the two of us</em> and enjoy both familiar and new music together.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="align-center" style="font-weight: 400;">FRIDAY<br><br></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Walking in during the afternoon, Matti Mikkola’s band Saimaa was finishing its set on the main stage. Saimaa is a massive band that seems capable of almost anything in terms of skill and style. They closed their performance with a huge 70s prog version of the <em>Finlandia</em> hymn. While marveling at that, we slowly drifted toward the Silver Arena, where one of my personal favorites was about to begin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">ina ended their career about ten years ago as the band members moved on to solo projects and other ventures. Before disbanding, however, they released the legendary <em>Soita mulle</em> album, which they now decided to perform in its entirety. Performing full albums has in recent years become something of a trend globally. Regina delivered the songs in an unpredictable order, mixing in older material as well. The nostalgia was tangible, but the songs still sounded relevant rather than dated. The band itself seemed quite moved by the situation. <em>Lepään aalloilla</em> had never been a standout favorite for me on the record, but live it was indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/wh14cFVr/Regina-Riikka-Vaahtera.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Regina-Riikka-Vaahtera" border="0"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After their one-hour set, we headed to the new Frontyard spot, set up between shipping containers behind a massive power plant. The new area worked brilliantly and was much more spacious. Never having been to Central European electronic music venues, I could still imagine the new Frontyard looking like something similar—an industrial atmosphere enhanced by Night Manouvers’ set. As darkness fell, the area became especially hypnotic with lights and smoke coming from all directions. Big props to Flow’s area designers for this change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After exploring the new Frontyard, we finally had some time to wander the festival grounds without worrying about missing favorites. Flow has always been a visually stunning festival full of art and creative lighting. This year again, there were many interesting spots where people gathered to sit and take pictures—most likely for social media. Maybe it was just my impression, but with small adjustments to the layout, the festival seemed to have more space for sitting down and resting one’s legs. We took a quick look at Sudan Archives and Montell Fish, both fitting well into Flow’s lineup in their own unique ways, though neither quite struck a chord with me personally.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/zWnxfpRw/FKA-Twigs-Konstantin-Kondrukhov.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="FKA-Twigs-Konstantin-Kondrukhov" border="0"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another full-album performance came the same day when the legendary French duo Air played their <em>Moon Safari</em> in its entirety. Air has been somewhat significant to me over the years, and I awaited their set with both excitement and uncertainty. I had seen them years ago in Helsinki, and it was one of my biggest live disappointments—feeling as if I were simply listening to the album at home, only much louder. This time, the duo came on stage with a live drummer, and as <em>La femme d’argent</em> began, my nervousness remained.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The music sounded beautiful and suited the warm summer evening in Helsinki perfectly. Birds glided across the sky as the crowd eased into a chilled atmosphere. During the first couple of songs, they had significant technical problems, but once those were resolved, they truly came alive. It was wonderful to witness such confident playing, especially how the drummer’s work supported the basslines so impressively. The repeated “merci”s from the stage, paired with simple visuals, made everything feel timeless and elegant.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Walking from Air’s set toward the hip-hop legends Black Star, I reflected on how my age group is now at the stage where nostalgia is being heavily leaned on—and I don’t mind at all. What could be better than hearing bands and artists from one’s youth again among all the new acts? Seeing Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli in Finland felt surreal. Both have long and remarkable careers in music and other arts, and I can only express deep respect. Flow’s energy was tight, and Silver Arena was packed with old-school rap heads, as shown by the countless hands bouncing in rhythm with the beats.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/C38Bkpzm/Air-Konstantin-Kondrukhov.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Air-Konstantin-Kondrukhov" border="0"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, at the same time, Autechre was playing in the Black Tent—a performance I had really wanted to catch. The duo was new to me, but reading about them beforehand made them sound fascinating. They performed without a single light, which is apparently their signature. Honestly, I wished they had been given a later slot, since the Finnish summer evening was still too bright for the tent to be properly dark. The soundscape was especially intriguing and at times even threatening. After listening for a while, however, we craved something a bit more approachable. Still, Autechre left a strong impression, and I’d happily hear them again in a proper club environment (to REALLY <em>listen them</em>, since there was nothing to see, heh).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Friday night’s headliner, FKA Twigs, was absolutely stunning—even though her music isn’t necessarily made for me. Barnett sang with incredible skill and purity, exuding charisma while also appearing vulnerable in front of thousands. Even without knowing her songs, I found myself immersed in her performance, especially her voice, which rang out crystal clear. And, of course, the visuals of an FKA Twigs show can’t be overlooked. I believe fans got far more than they could have wished for.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/6cgT91Yk/Bicep-Konstantin-Kondrukhov.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Bicep-Konstantin-Kondrukhov" border="0"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the night turned to early morning, positive messages came from the grandparents’ house: the kids had gone to bed well, and everything had gone smoothly. After a quick rest and a meal, we headed to another of my personal highlights. Bicep had just begun their AV DJ set, and the tent was packed with people enjoying the kind of intense electronic music that forces every cell of your body to dance. There’s something about Bicep’s music that resonates with me perfectly, and it was incredible to share that experience with thousands of others dancing late into the night. The light show was at least as intense, perfectly synchronized with the music. It was without doubt one of the most breathtaking light shows I’ve ever witnessed. Bicep danced the crowd into exhaustion, and after the festival closed, the trip home felt endlessly long after all that beauty.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="align-center" style="font-weight: 400;">SATURDAY<br><br></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The next day started slowly. A quick check-in with the grandparents reassured us that everything was fine, so we could enjoy the second day in peace. As we entered the grounds, we could already hear young fans singing loudly along with Olga. We only glanced briefly before heading to see Pehmoaino. Her dramatic music seemed to resonate strongly with the younger crowd, much like Olga’s but in a completely different style. Many sang along at full volume, clearly swept up in the moment. Pehmoaino’s music blends traditional Finnish influences with modern expression in a way that sometimes confuses me, as I struggle to find a clear point of connection. Still, I somehow enjoy her over-the-top dramatic style.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All that drama was soon washed away by the dance music of the Backyard, where Trevor Deep Jr. and friends got the crowd moving with soulful house. It was wonderful to watch the diverse festival crowd basking in the sun—some looking as casual as any ordinary day, while others were dressed more spectacularly than ever.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One Finnish band that has grown in popularity in recent years is Ruusut, led by Ringa Manner and Miikka Koivisto. They played a special set, performing lots of new material—some tracks without even names yet, according to them. Fans were surely excited. I personally enjoy their work, though at times some of the vocals didn’t quite suit my taste. Still, Ringa Manner is one of the most remarkable singers in the Finnish and even international scene—her voice no less stunning than FKA Twigs’. Special mention must also go to Ruusut’s bass sound, which was probably the heaviest of the entire festival.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/TBgFx6m0/Oranssi-Pazuzu-Konstantin-Kondrukhov.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Oranssi-Pazuzu-Konstantin-Kondrukhov" border="0"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of Flow’s greatest strengths is its incredible musical diversity. From Ruusut’s experimental electronic productions, it was an easy jump to Veronica Maggio’s summery indie pop, and from there into the dark, hypnotic world of Oranssi Pazuzu. Their show was absolutely one of the festival’s highlights. Their last two albums are masterpieces of psychedelia, experimentation, atmosphere, and heaviness. The band’s playing was seamless, and at some point I realized this was one of the few bands performing without any electronic backing—everything was purely organic instrumentation. Oranssi Pazuzu deserves a strong mention, and I would gladly see them again anytime. During their set, everything felt exactly as it should.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, right after Oranssi Pazuzu, Little Simz began—also high on my priority list—so I had to cut the last 10–15 minutes short to secure a good spot. Little Simz opened with the first track from her latest album, <em>Thief</em>, instantly giving me chills. From the very first seconds, her charisma and boundless energy were undeniable. The set was built mostly from the new record and her acclaimed <em>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</em>, with a few other selections. One of the most surprising and exciting highlights, however, was how much space she gave to songs from <em>Drop 7</em>—some of her most experimental and interesting work. I love those tracks, and hearing <em>Mood Swings</em>, <em>Fever</em>, <em>Torch</em>, and <em>SOS</em> all in a row was amazing. Little Simz’s charisma and versatility will carry her much further than where she already is. Her skills are simply unbelievable.</p>
<p>The final evening was a tough one for scheduling conflicts: the South African DJ duo Major League DJz overlapped with both Kneecap and the techno legends Underworld. Major League DJz worked brilliantly on the small X Garden stage, drawing a good crowd to enjoy their afrobeats, 3step, and amapiano. The twin brothers radiated confidence behind the decks, captivating the Flow audience. Kneecap brought their anarchistic, political show to Finland, and the tent was completely packed even though we arrived early before they started. Their set was aggressive and humorous at once, pulling everyone in. Throughout the day, there had been several statements of solidarity with Palestine, but Kneecap emphasized this more than anyone—unsurprisingly. Their performance was entertaining, but I still couldn’t resist catching at least a short part of Underworld’s set. The legendary duo’s techno sounded magnificent, and <em>Born Slippy</em> was, for me, the perfect ending to the festival. This time, our Flow experience was only two days long, as parental duties began calling us back home.</p>
<hr>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Flow 2025 was a successful and wonderful experience. As I wrote earlier, Flow brings together an astonishingly wide range of genres—from mainstream pop to African disco, from psychedelic metal to techno. It truly is a dream festival for any music lover, never locking itself into a single category.Looking back, Flow 2025 was more than just a festival—it was a reminder of why live music matters. For two short days, everyday responsibilities faded, and we stepped into a world built from sound, light, and shared emotion. The lineup, the atmosphere, and the people created something that felt both familiar and extraordinary. Walking back into family life afterward, a little sleep-deprived but deeply recharged, I carried with me not only the music but also the sense of freedom and connection it brought. Flow proved once again that even in the busiest seasons of life, there’s value in carving out space for music, for community, and for simply being present together in the moment.</p>

                <p data-start="102" data-end="466">At just 18, Maddy Low is already carving her place in New Zealand’s indie scene with a sound that feels both timeless and refreshingly her own. Splitting her time between Wellington and Auckland, she writes songs that swing between two poles — the quiet introspection of lying on your back, staring at the ceiling, and the euphoric rush of dancing under the sun.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="102" data-end="466"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3uIsve9Dn2WsIYgE3C7I86?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p data-start="102" data-end="466"> </p>
<p data-start="468" data-end="766">Blending indie, folk, and pop with flashes of classic rock grit, Maddy’s guitar work reveals a maturity beyond her years. Since she first took to the streets as a 13-year-old busker, she’s honed an effortless connection with audiences, whether performing for passersby or commanding a live stage.</p>
<p data-start="768" data-end="1071">Her authenticity extends to her YouTube channel, where stripped-back, personal takes on songs by Amy Winehouse, The Cranberries, Olivia Rodrigo, and Sublime have resonated with thousands, proof that Maddy’s appeal lies in more than just skill; it’s in the emotional honesty she pours into every note.</p>
<p data-start="1073" data-end="1174" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Maddy Low is part storyteller, part soul-bearer, part sunshine,<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> </span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> and she’s only just getting started.</span></p>

                <p>Every August, Helsinki’s Suvilahti transforms into a dazzling playground of music, art, and culture for Flow Festival. Known for its genre-blending lineup, from cutting-edge electronic to boundary-pushing hip-hop, post-punk, and Nordic indie, Flow creates a space of sound across its intimate, massive and unique stages. But Flow is more than music: it’s where visual art installations glow in industrial spaces, street food tempts every taste bud, and design-forward details make every corner interesting. With its sustainable ethos, stylish crowd, and midnight sun vibes, Flow builds a feeling that is hard to describe. Whether you're here for deep beats, bold performances, or simply to soak in the city's most vibrant weekend, Flow promises a multisensory escape.</p>

<p>Here are a few must-see shows at this year’s Flow Festival.</p>
<hr>
<p class="align-left"> <strong>Air – Moon Safari Live Set</strong></p>
<p>Celebrating the 25th anniversary of Moon Safari, French duo Air have recently mounted full-album live shows in major venues like London and Vancouver. Critics hailed one such show at London's Coliseum as “a widescreen extravaganza” that transcended nostalgia. The show will be built on lush visuals, immersive staging and thick grooves, transforming Moon Safari into a living dreamscape. At Flow, this performance would offer a chill-out journey that's both cinematic and timeless.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3SXwqSqAoBz9WCI9PDQzY6?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Regina – Soita Mulle Live Set</strong></p>
<p>The Finnish trio Regina revisits Soita Mulle, a cult indie-dream-pop album from 2011 featuring hushed dreampop tones and atmospheric grooves. Pitchfork praised vocalist Iisa Pykäri’s evolving clarity, calling it Regina’s most cohesive work to date. As a Finnish band performing a beloved domestic classic, their set would feel intimate and celebratory, perfect for music lovers eager for local legacy and dreamy heartfelt storytelling.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/vCQm503F/Oranssi-Pazuzu-1.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Oranssi-Pazuzu-1" border="0"></p>
<p><strong>Bicep presents CHROMA – AV DJ set</strong></p>
<p>Bicep’s Chroma AV DJ set is a hybrid audiovisual experience - a DJ mix built on their own tracks plus other mood-driven tracks synced tightly with custom visuals. Viewers called their Finsbury Park performance a “masterclass” of immersive electronic art. At Flow, this would be ideal for lovers of audiovisual spectacle.</p>
<p><strong>Autechre</strong></p>
<p>Autechre’s live sets are famously cryptic and immersive: long-form hour-plus pieces played in near darkness, building fractal percussive tension and alien chord structures. Their shows have been described as a sonic labyrinth that makes the venue “thrum” with uncanny energy. For Flow’s experimental crowd, experiencing Autechre live is entering a realm of pure electronic exploration, one not to skip.</p>
<p><strong>Little Simz</strong></p>
<p>Little Simz continues to impress critics and fans alike: closing Meltdown Festival with what one review termed a “dazzling, defiant orchestral triumph,” she married orchestral arrangement with raw rap emotion. Live reviewers note her infectious swagger onstage and the emotional depth of her vocals in intimate and arena settings alike. At Flow, her set would bring lyric-driven rap, orchestral textures, and commanding stage presence to a wider Finnish crowd.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/s9gfndQw/little-simz.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="little-simz" border="0"></p>
<p><strong>Kneecap</strong></p>
<p>Belfast’s Kneecap delivers high-energy rap fused with political provocation in Irish and English. Their live shows, fraught with call and response, mosh pits and socio-political rhetoric, have made them exhilarating and controversial at festivals like Glastonbury and Wide Awake. Despite legal scrutiny, fans describe their performances as “funny, anarchic and rebellious. Kneecap blends bold politics with big energy—don’t miss the chance to witness it live.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/fYqr17LK/kneecap.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="kneecap" border="0"></p>
<p><strong>Oranssi Pazuzu</strong></p>
<p>Finnish psych-black-metal pioneers Oranssi Pazuzu bring immersive, ritualistic live performances defined by dense sonic layering and self-engineered lighting that alter perception. In a Solstafir, Oranssi Pazuzu’s show, critics described being left “totally drained and energised” by the hypnotic set. Lovers of heavier music craving visceral psychedelia and sonic transcendence will find it here.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/3XFQRe2FsSOjrODygK4caW?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Major League DJz</strong></p>
<p>South African twin duo Major League DJz have become international amapiano ambassadors, the first artists in the genre at Coachella, blending kwaito, Afrobeats and hip hop with infectious energy. Fans rave about their Boiler Room sets in Miami and Montreal, and DJ Mag praises their braggadocio with deep musicality. On Flow, they’ll bring dance-floor joy, global sw<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">agger, and shake up the dancefloor with a whole new groove.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/ZpLdDjdv/Major-League-DJz.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Major-League-DJz" border="0"></p>
<p><strong>Fontaines D.C.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Fontaines D.C. are set to deliver a post-punk performance that goes far beyond nostalgia—brimming with urgency, raw emotion, and present-day power. With their intense, heartfelt delivery, they draw in both devoted fans and curious newcomers alike, creating a collective moment of catharsis. It’s the kind of set that could very well become a defining highlight for post-punk lovers at this year’s Flow Festival.</span><br><br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/MyvmQGLP/fontainesdc.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="fontainesdc" border="0"></p>
<p>From dreamy electronica to raw punk energy and bass-heavy grooves, Flow’s lineup is packed with unforgettable moments. Don’t miss your chance to catch these artists live—your perfect Flow experience starts here. See you in the crowd!<br><br></p>

                <p data-start="169" data-end="582">Fresh out of the underground scene in Kivenlahti, Finland, Waking Iris returns with their second single, <em data-start="274" data-end="286">“Perfect,”</em> a moody, guitar-driven anthem that delves into the emotional wreckage of infidelity. Led by Canadian vocalist and songwriter Brian Forth, the track marks a striking emotional departure from their high-octane debut <em data-start="501" data-end="518">“Rock Forever,”</em> released in May, showcasing the band’s range and growing depth.</p>
<p data-start="584" data-end="1064">Written in the aftermath of Forth’s divorce, <em data-start="629" data-end="640">“Perfect”</em> isn’t a song of blame or bitterness, it’s a somber acknowledgment of what it means to accept life’s imperfections. <em data-start="755" data-end="888">“Rather than wallow in self-pity, I wanted to write something that made peace with the reality that nothing is perfect in the end,”</em> Forth shares. That emotional maturity resonates through the band’s searing guitar riffs, melancholic melodies, and a vocal performance that burns with both regret and release.</p>

<p data-start="1206" data-end="1622">Backed by Finnish rock veterans, Waking Iris blends ’80s melodic rock with the grit of ’90s grunge. Lead guitarist Tim Norrgrann (Gtarzee) delivers soaring solos and layered textures, while Reda Kramdi’s dynamic drumming and Ilkka Pättiniemi’s pulsing bass lines drive the emotional weight forward. Pauliina Järvisalo’s keyboards add atmosphere and melodic nuance, rounding out the band’s sound with cinematic flair.</p>
<p data-start="1624" data-end="1974">The track was recorded across borders, partly at Soundwell Studio in Finland with Valtteri Kallio, and at Stockholm’s Groundzero Studios with Swedish producers Joakim Hillson and Johan Öberg, who also handled mixing duties. Final mastering was completed by Tomas Caris Andersson at Carisma Studio in Sweden, giving <em data-start="1938" data-end="1949">“Perfect”</em> a polished yet raw edge.</p>
<p data-start="1976" data-end="2262" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With <em data-start="1981" data-end="1993">“Perfect,”</em> Waking Iris proves they’re not just another rock revival act, they’re a band unafraid to show vulnerability through volume, and heartache through harmony. As they continue to evolve, this single cements their place as one of Helsinki’s most compelling new rock exports.</p>
