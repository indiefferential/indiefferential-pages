<p class="align-center"><strong>Louise Goffin: Brooklyn-Born, Laurel Canyon-Souled<br></strong></p>
<p>Brooklyn-born multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Louise Goffin has always been deeply curious about music’s power to connect and transform. With creativity coursing through her veins, thanks to her renowned songwriter parents Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Louise grew up in an environment that was as inspiring as it was complex—her father’s bipolar disorder adding layers of depth and introspection to her artistry.<br><br>Now in what she describes as the most fulfilling phase of her career, Louise’s music continues to blossom in unexpected ways. Drawing inspiration from the rich legacy of Laurel Canyon, her lyrics are deeply personal and introspective, reminiscent of the storytelling giants she grew up admiring.</p>

<p>Stephen Dowd, a talented Canadian songwriter based in Ottawa, Ontario, has been steadily carving his path in the music scene with his heartfelt lyrics and eclectic musical style. Over the course of 2024, he has recorded and released three captivating tracks, each showcasing a unique blend of genres and his evolving artistic vision.<br><br>The journey began in May with the release of “You’re Beautiful To Me,” a tender ballad that resonated deeply with listeners for its sincere lyrics and emotive delivery. Dowd followed up in August with the energetic Pop/Rock anthem “Heaven Won’t Wait,” a collaborative effort co-written with Gareth Auden-Hole. This track added a dynamic edge to his repertoire, blending infectious rhythms with introspective storytelling.<br><br>Now, Dowd has taken a bold step into the Dance/Pop realm with his latest single, “(Ça S’en Vient) It’s Coming Can You Feel It.” This third release marks a significant departure from his earlier work, showcasing his versatility and ability to craft songs that pulse with energy and excitement.</p>

                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to? </strong></p>
<p>I’m based out of Melbourne, Australia in a northern suburb called Northcote. I’m currently recording my second full length EP which is set for release mid next year! Just over a week ago I released the latest single from that body of work, ‘When I Feel Like Giving Up’.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired the creation of “When I Feel Like Giving Up”? </strong></p>
<p>This tune started out as almost a kind of musical journal entry. I didn’t intend to include it on the album but the more I worked on and listened back to the song the more I felt like it deserved to be heard. I had been going through a hard time when I wrote that song, and reflecting on what my life was like when I was younger. Naive and carefree.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="https://ibb.co/tb2j62S"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/cN8f98P/LANDSCAPE-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="LANDSCAPE-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw" border="0"></a></p>
<p><strong>How did you start? </strong></p>
<p>I’ve been apart of the music industry since I was 16. A working session musician from the age of 19 when I moved to Melbourne. However, I didn’t start doing my own thing and releasing music under The Terrifying Lows till end of 2018. I always wanted to be a songwriter and have my own solo project but was always tied up with other artists’ touring and recording schedules.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most challenging part of writing or producing this song? </strong></p>
<p>I think giving myself the space to be vulnerable and completely honest with myself and my audience is always the most challenging part of the process to me. Definitely the writing rather than the production. I love recording so much that any obstacles I encounter along the way are more like fun little side quests.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2odl8Ay49sxEdUJFJZzgNe?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist? </strong></p>
<p>When I’m not working a typical day would start with some black coffee, exercise and then spending basically all day in my home studio. This is where I do the bulk of my writing and recording so whether I’m coming up with new ideas or chipping away at the next record, I spend a lot of time in this room.</p>
<p><strong>How has your sound evolved since your self-titled debut LP? </strong></p>
<p>I feel like I’m a project by project kind of guy. Crafting an overall sound for one body of work then moving onto the next. Definitely a lot less guitar focused in this new batch of songs. Moving away from Alt-Rock and just becoming more Alternative-Indie.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="https://ibb.co/XsyB0P4"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/J7xL6Td/PORTRAIT-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="PORTRAIT-2-by-Ian-Laidlaw" border="0"></a></p>
<p><strong>How do you reach new audiences? What advice or tips would you give to new artists? </strong></p>
<p>I still think performing is such a great way to reach a new audience. If people see you play an awesome live show then they’re going to pay attention. There’s also social media but I have the millennial disdain for it too. If I had to give any advice on social media it would be just do what you do and stay authentic. If you’re not the kinda person who is comfortable doing what everyone else is doing across the social media platforms then don’t do it. Find your own thing… people can tell when it’s not genuine. Don’t get bullied by your manager/ label reps to make dances on TikTok if that’s not your style.</p>
<p><strong>How do you translate the emotional intensity of your recordings to a live setting? </strong></p>
<p>I feel like the emotional intensity really increases at my live shows. Singing live is a less calculated exercise so I can deliver the lyrics in a freer and more emotional way. I always give space to my band to develop on the parts on the recording and add their own voice to the performances which helps a lot as well.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music? </strong></p>
<p>I think AI writes terrible lyrics so there’ll always be place for real human emotion and narratives. I see being a useful tool for somethings and the death of certain aspects of the music industry. Like jingle writing for example.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release. </strong></p>
<p>My latest single ‘When I Feel Like Giving Up’ is out now across all platforms! It’s the 4th single from my upcoming second LP. This song serves as a cathartic anthem for those navigating dark moments.</p>

                <p class="align-left">From the creative heart of Melbourne (Naarm/Boonwurung) comes Sunset Salore, a singer-songwriter whose music reflects a journey of growth, resilience, and transformation. Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland, she draws deeply from her own life experiences, embracing the challenges and changes that have shaped her. This introspection takes center stage in her debut EP, Love Kills the Monsters, a bold first step into solo artistry. The record weaves together funky bass lines, sultry grooves, and an alternative pop sensibility, offering a collection of stories told with striking emotional depth.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/hYfp5vN/18d719b77d6defa0bc171c69495b7c1e.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="18d719b77d6defa0bc171c69495b7c1e" border="0"></p>
<p>For Sunset Salore, this project represents more than music—it’s a reflection of her personal evolution. “The songs are about acknowledging moments that have passed, recognizing how they defined me, and learning to grow from them,” she explains. Writing and recording the EP became a cathartic process, a way to process the struggles of the past few years and find a brighter, more hopeful outlook. The title itself speaks to her mindset. “It’s the idea that love—whether for yourself or others—can quiet your inner demons. Maybe, just maybe, love can kill the monsters.”<br><br>Her path to this moment has been shaped by a lifetime immersed in music. Sunset Salore discovered her love for it early, influenced by her eclectic taste and the vibrant music culture of Belfast. “I’ve always been drawn to so many different styles, and I think that naturally informs the way I approach my own sound,” she says. In her twenties, she became a familiar face in local music circles, performing in bands and honing her craft on keys and vocals. When she moved to Melbourne, she found new inspiration in its live music scene, making the city’s stages her own.<br><br><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong><br><br>Online you’ll find me mostly on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sunsetsalore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunsetsalore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and my <a href="https://sunsetsalore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> where you’ll find all the new things happening. In person though, I’m getting ready for the launch gig for ‘Love Kills the Monsters’ which is happening 1st February in the Bergy Bandroom, Melbourne. That, and the launch of the music video for ‘Call It’ which launches today (15th Nov), is keeping me busy!</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YGy5IC4yck?si=-1HfxehUQ8g1ZRaM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p><br><strong>Can you pinpoint a moment or artist that truly inspired you to pursue music seriously?</strong><br><br>I was really enchanted by Florence Welch from Florence and the Machine. Fabulous voice control, lots of emotion, and a real musicality that shone through her songwriting. I started doing a lot of Florence covers, working on runs, pitch expansion, and songwriting more seriously after that. She has had an amazing career and discography, but it was probably after ‘Lungs’ that I really started taking my own music more seriously.<br><br><strong>What was the first song on the EP that felt like a defining moment for you?</strong><br><br>The first song I wrote was ‘Love Kills the Monsters’, and that really set the tone, but it wasn’t until ‘Call It’ that I felt it was taking shape. It was a really natural process after that, everything kind of flowed. If anything it was hard to narrow down what to take forward. It was originally going to be a 4-5 track EP maximum, and well, it’s 7 tracks, so definitely a hard choice!</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/4KcgK5lGq3s9vMNSV6c4Qx?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br><strong>You describe "Call It" as being about recognizing when a relationship no longer works. How do you approach writing about such raw, personal topics?</strong><br><br>I’d been writing regularly before ‘Call It’ happened, mostly running with a discipline of practice of a certain number of songs a week. I was working on themes, topics, runs, concepts, musical riffs, genres, etc and seeing what stuck. I’d written my self-imposed ‘quota’ for the week and struggled to produce anything that I loved (though the process for me is to keep writing and throw away what I’m not enjoying, just trying really not to over think things). I slept on it, and the next day was a bit stressful for entirely unrelated reasons. I came home, and ‘Call It’ just flowed when I channeled that frustration. While the stoking of that fire was unrelated to the topic, I wanted to revisit the moments I’d felt frustrated, and this was top of mind, a visceral feeling really. From there I’d written the melody and most of the lyrics in 15 minutes, and it got stuck in my head so I knew I was probably on to something. When you have something that works, it’s easy to be vulnerable.<br><br><strong>How do you start a new song? Do you typically begin with a lyric or a melody?</strong><br><br>I do both! It depends on the song or topic I’m working on really. For ‘Call It’ I had the riff first, and built everything else around that. For ‘Don’t Owe You Pretty’ I had the concept and ‘feel’ and went from there. Sometimes I really like a vibe or a bassline and can start from there. It’s pretty flexible.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/yFVTPnk/4d58fcafc3b81e8d00599ff37ec0c9b2.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="4d58fcafc3b81e8d00599ff37ec0c9b2" border="0"></p>
<p><br><strong>What's a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong><br><br>Normally, it’s writing. Lately because I’m in a releasing phase on new material, I’m juggling both. The writing doesn’t really stop and I do a weekly session with my coach to stay on track with this. I have a day job, because let’s be honest, unless you’re a top tier musician, it’s really tough to make enough money to survive and have the luxury of self funding music recording and releasing, so I work an office job Monday - Friday to keep me afloat. Around that I am currently promoting the EP, so that might be interviews on radio, some press articles, or planning set lists for gigs, maybe a band rehearsal. I do all the promotion myself too, so I might be contacting venues, spending time in emails, maybe working up a flyer in Canva or something. It means I wear many hats! The hardest thing is to do all that, while creating new music in the background so you have a pipeline. I also have family and personal relationships to maintain, and animals to look after (several cats and a horse), so I fit a lot in my day!</p>
<p><br><strong>What’s the most unexpected thing you’ve learned about yourself through creating music?</strong><br><br>I really hate self promotion, but I have managed to make it work under the Sunset Salore brand name, because it makes me feel like I’m wearing my music hat, not my everyday hat. The music is more important for me to get out there than any feelings of ‘weirdness’ when I’m promoting it. At least that’s what I’m telling myself! This is the first time (this EP) where I have been proud to listen to the material and share it with the world as I feel like the timing is right, the quality is right, the team I’m working with is right, and I finally have a story to tell. I think I was just not ready before now to take this leap and back myself.<br><br><strong>Is there a particular message you hope listeners take away from Love Kills the Monsters?</strong><br><br>That you’re in control of your own narrative, and that you can choose love for yourself regardless of what’s happening. I think I worked on self-care, kindness and acceptance in writing this EP in a really cathartically reflective space. I hope that transcends to the listener in some way too.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I’m not a fan. I believe there’s a personality that comes across in created works that doesn’t translate in AI. The pain, the joy, the love, the experiences that we channel to get to the place of creating the art of music is skipped in AI creations. I think that functionally they’ll be hard to distinguish, but it’ll be a shame if the human core is removed and this takes over, particularly as it’s learning craft from musicians in the first place. Creatives are overlooked and underpaid enough without AI taking over and squeezing them out entirely, or pushing music into a bedroom art which never sees the light of day because AI is making gains people should be. I think the technology is impressive, but ethically I have a problem with it.<br><br><strong>What worked for you promotion-wise? Is there any advice for upcoming artists out there?</strong><br><br>I’m still finding out! I couldn’t find a particularly helpful ‘manual’ out there or a playbook for what works. I just experimented with different things. I think Streaming numbers opened the doors for me on other platforms like Radio, but I think streaming is so crowded and returns so low, that radio or other mediums are probably overlooked. I have had the most enthusiastic support from radio and engaging with people which streaming doesn’t let me do quite the same. I think don’t get too swept up in what you ‘should’ do and think about what success looks like for you. That might be local community exposure, festivals, radio, or streaming, or something else entirely. Those strategies would be totally different without significant financial backing to do them all. The more of this I’m doing the more I’m realigning what success looks like for me. Billboard charts aren’t realistic for me, but I’m stoked to be charting on other avenues, and celebrating the wins as you grow your audience is so powerful for your motivation too!</p>

<p><br><br><strong>What’s next for Sunset Salore? Can we expect a full album, or are you planning more singles?</strong><br><br>After the launch gig on 1st February, I’d like to take a small break. I’ll be doing some travel to Japan and South Korea, and spending time with family to recharge, and of course make more memories to take forward into new material. I’ve a lot of material ready to move to the next stage already, so I suspect that timing and funding will play a large part in my next step after that. Either way, there will be new music, so watch this space!</p>

                <p>Essex-based band Midnight Repost comes at the ready with their debut EP, Out By Ten. Explored through this five-track EP are ideas of redemption, forgiveness, and self-acceptance. This first collection shows how their sound is changing: a mix of pop, rock, indie, and funk. They recorded Out By Ten in a quiet studio in Norway, which helps show both Midnight Repost's creativity and their desire to explore sound.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1VLtG7y2QG5neA9duahTvh?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br>Each of the tracks tells part of the story of the EP. The lyrics, which are by the frontman Liam Priestnall, go through the outline of a troubled character who battles with selfishness and arrogance. Boasted with lush, expansive guitars, smooth synths, and strong beats, a very impactful journey transpires—from selfishness to insight into one's self, a clear image of personal change.</p>

<h1 class="align-center"><a href="https://zildjian.sjv.io/c/5298563/2164604/23171" target="_top" id="2164604"><img loading="lazy" src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23171-2164604" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="" border="0"></a><img loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5298563/2164604/23171" data-is-external-image="true"  border="0"></h1>

<p><br><br>Midnight Repost has built up a strong fanbase over the summer, gigging up and down the UK. They added their own creative style to those classic styles of music, which has gotten them played on national radio, including BBC Radio 1, BBC Essex, and BBC Rapal. Their songs "Stay," "Blue Eyes," and "Fantasy" from the EP have created excitement. Their official EP release is Out By Ten on September 6 and will surely bring the band even more attention.</p>

<p>Out By Ten, Midnight Repost has found the right balance between strong feelings and smooth music. The best part about this EP has to be the guitar playing—that is spot-on and heartfelt. The guitar parts within each song are well incorporated, creating an interesting blend of dark, powerful riffs with soft and airy sounds. All of these elements create a three-dimensional feel, making the space bigger and allowing a deep level of involvement in the story for listeners.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="https://zildjian.sjv.io/dOo5VK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/x86K3rT/image.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="image" border="0"></a></p>
<p><br><br>Mixing on this EP is truly great; it's so clear, allowing every single part to shine while making the emotional changes in the EP stronger. From synths to vocals, every part has a space of its own, but they all fit very well within the overall sound. The result is that the listening experience is full where every part, from the strong beat of the drums to the softest sounds of the bass, has been crafted and mixed with an artist's skill. It just feels lively, giving Out By Ten both a sense of closeness and depth that invites listeners to find new details each time they put it on.</p>

                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong><br><br>I am currently located in Los Angeles. I am working on my new EP, which will be released soon. I am writing and exploring new sounds, drawing inspiration from the city and the environment I am in, and the amazing people I meet here.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/sqw41Zy/A70-FB7-F2-0727-4491-AC60-97-B82-FB995-FF-2.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="A70-FB7-F2-0727-4491-AC60-97-B82-FB995-FF-2" border="0"></p>
<p><br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong><br><br>Success to me is about connecting with people through my music. my goal is to make people feel that they are not alone and that their voices matter and deserve to be heard. I aim to create music that resonates deeply with people and to build a community around my work where everyone feels seen and understood.<br><br><strong>How has your journey as an independent artist in Los Angeles shaped your music career so far?</strong><br><br>I moved there two years ago to pursue my dreams. Being away from my family and friends, and the life I know, was a difficult and fulfilling journey at the same time. I met new friends from all around the world while studying music here, and I opened my mind to new types of music and creativity. My new EP was written here and was inspired by my songwriting class and my new experiences. Since moving here, I have learned a lot about myself, my goals, and my artistic identity.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/59nCaN3QPsSIHPZPDV1vce?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong><br><br>Every day, I begin with a cup of coffee while chatting with my family and friends who live on the other side of the world. Afterwards, I work on my project at my small home studio in my apartment. I also make an effort to attend open mic events around Los Angeles to connect with other talented artists.<br><br><strong>Can you describe a memorable moment from the recording sessions of "Take You Home"?</strong><br><br>I wrote "Take You Home" in my songwriting class after we learned about a type of song structure that was used by artists like Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra. One of the most memorable moments for me was hearing the song transition from my notebook at the end of the class to the recording session and then to the finished product. My producer, Lukas, added an amazing guitar to the melody I composed, and it was the right fit that was missing. I was excited to see how the song turned out.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/gVXjpPW/15-AF513-A-95-EC-4-EC2-ADD1-B54-DEE272169.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="15-AF513-A-95-EC-4-EC2-ADD1-B54-DEE272169" border="0"></p>
<p><br><strong>Can you share more about the significance of Debbie Harry as an influence and what inspired you to write "Debbie" as a tribute?</strong><br><br>Debbie Harry and Blondie have been a huge inspiration to me. Her fearless style, powerful voice, and the way she commands the stage are things I deeply admire. "Debbie" is a tribute to her impact on music and culture, and it's my way of expressing gratitude for the trail she blazed for artists like me, especially women, in the music industry.<br><br><strong>What challenges have you faced as a queer artist in the music industry, and how have you overcome them?</strong><br><br>As a queer artist, I've faced unique challenges, but I've overcome them by staying true to myself. From dealing with prejudices to finding a place in a sometimes narrow-minded industry, it hasn't been easy. However, our strong community and unashamed artists have made a difference. While I might have hesitated to openly express my queerness in the past, today I proudly embrace who I am, and I want to inspire others to do the same. There are many people who feel like they can't be themselves, and I want to show them that they can and that they have a place.</p>

<p><br><br><strong>How do you approach the songwriting process? Do you start with lyrics, melodies, or a specific theme?</strong><br><br>My songwriting process varies. I mostly write about things that happen to me. If I have a bad feeling or am feeling sad, writing helps me process my feelings and deal with them. I always write the lyrics before the melody; it's rare that I'll do the melody first. For me, the lyrics are the most important part. I like to let the song develop organically, allowing each element to influence the others until it all comes together.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6sSnzX8HnkvZnNqi3GOFhc?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br><strong>Looking ahead, what are your goals for your music career, and what can fans expect from you in the future?</strong><br><br>I am passionate about pushing musical boundaries and exploring new sounds. Fans can look forward to more releases and live shows, and catch me at some open mic events. I am thrilled for the upcoming release of my new EP and can't wait to share it with everyone. My ultimate goal is to continue evolving as an artist and to connect with people through my music and art.</p>
