                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up too?</strong><br><br>Well, at the moment I’m a full time uni student studying music in London. I’m doing a performance and production course, which I’m having so much fun with! I’ve been learning how to produce my own music and even doing my own compositions as I’m now learning to play piano too. I’ve always loved performing, so I’m really enjoying delving deeper into the music industry in a new way. Alongside this, with the release of ‘Control Freak’, I’ve been trying to build my online presence across my social media platforms and it’s been really fun filming new types of content to post so that people get to know me as an artist and as a person.<br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong><br><br>For me, I just want people to enjoy my music. I want anyone who feels like they can relate to my songs, to be able to turn up the volume and head-bang to the lyrics or shout them out! I want to tour the world one day because I love being up on a stage and I love interacting with a crowd. Honestly, it means so much to me when someone tells me they can resonate with one of my songs, and that’s what I would define as a success. So, I guess my long term goal is to keep doing what I’m doing, but on a larger scale. I want to get my music out there, and it’s something I’m not going to give up on!</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/7GfLRo8U1dHsRJ5xpdFBMZ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br><strong>How did you start?</strong><br><br>I’ve always loved singing from a very young age and I can remember being in the car with my mum and singing along to different CD’s she had whenever we would go out. It was only when I was ten-years-old, that I realised I wanted to be an artist and that being on stage was just something I loved. I was on holiday at a caravan park and they were putting on a talent competition, which I decided to enter last minute. I remember being so nervous before going up on stage, I got upset and almost didn’t do it. Yet, as soon as I got up there and started singing, I didn’t want to stop! I knew from that moment that it was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. From there, I ended up winning the competition and got to the National finals! I will always be grateful that I ended up getting on stage that day, as it really was the doorway that led me to where I am now.</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/FkRp7G5r/image10-1.jpg" alt="image10 (1)" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong><br><br>Right now, as an independent artist, it’s really just about trying to push myself out there and making noise about the new release! I’m always writing new music, and now that I’m at uni learning to do so much more, I’m able to put that into practise at home as well. As I mentioned previously, I’m always planning on new content to post on social media, and I’m trying at the moment to post multiple things everyday to keep my pages active. I have a lot of fun filming TikTok’s especially and recording song covers, so I guess a typical day really just consists of music and anything interesting I can post haha.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I have never used AI in any of my music and personally it’s not something I’d probably ever use when it comes to creating anything musically. I’m a very creative person, so AI kind of takes that away from me and anyone else who enjoys the creative process of writing or composing a song. I understand that people use AI in a lot of different ways, but when you have people who work so hard putting their creative vision into a song and then compare it with a song made entirely from AI, I feel like it takes the opportunities away from that creative individual. It’s definitely a big conversation in the music industry at the moment, and I think in any creative industry too.<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong><br><br>My song ‘Control Freak’ has just come out and I have to say it’s definitely one of my favourite songs I’ve done! It’s so petty and sarcastic, but it’s also a lot of fun to listen and sing along too. I feel like everyone at some point in their lives has dealt with who they’d label a ‘control freak’ and sometimes it’s nice to be able to air that frustration out in a bold and sassy way! It’s quite a different vibe to my other songs, but I love experimenting with different sounds and different genres too. I worked with an incredible producer, Jim Hustwit, who was able to create something exactly how I’d envisioned when I wrote the song.</p>

                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?<br><br></strong>Right now, you can find me in the DC area, however, I have not transitioned into live shows quite yet, so if you want to find me, my online presence is the best place! Lately, I’ve been deep in album mode: finishing songs, refining visuals, and building a world around my upcoming music that feels honest and lived-in. (All while trying to balance my personal life and all of its’ chaos!)</p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/LDGjgj9S/image.jpg" alt="image" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?<br></strong><br>Success, to me, is longevity and integrity. It’s making work that feels true to who I am even as I change, and finding the people who feel seen in it/can relate to it. The goal isn’t virality for a moment but rather connection over time. If my songs become something someone returns to during different seasons of their life, that’s success.<br><br><strong>How did you start?<br></strong><br>I started writing songs long before I ever thought of releasing them mostly as a way to process things in a constructive manner. Music was always where I could be the most honest, but also the most vulnerable. cooper mae came way later, when I realized I didn’t want these songs to live quietly just on paper anymore. It felt less like “starting a project” and more like finally letting myself take up space in the world.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/09WvwzsALKs7YlPyWBlwGX?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?<br></strong><br>There’s no such thing as a truly typical day, which I think is part of the magic. Some days are very unglamorous. Voice memos, rewrites, mixing, admin tasks, social media, emails. Other days are purely creative: writing lyrics, experimenting with production, or perfecting a melody that won’t leave my head. And then you also have the couch potato days, where I do nothing related to music what so ever. The through-line is consistency though. Showing up again and again even after taking some time off. <br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?<br></strong><br>I see AI as a tool, not a replacement. It can be useful for brainstorming or speeding up certain workflows, but it can’t replicate lived experience, nuance, or emotional risk. The most compelling music still comes from being human and a little (a lot) uncomfortable. AI can assist the process, but it can’t write your truth for you. That’s the best part of art. That’s what keeps it raw and human. <br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.<br></strong><br>My upcoming work is something that I like to call slightly unhinged honesty. My new album (‘notes from the archive’ release date TBD) is introspective and emotionally sharp, but still catchy and also quite intimate. The songs are really exploring day to day themes like modern love, self-awareness culture, feminism, and emotional accountability. Just with a bit of humor and bite. To me, it became a collection that feels like flipping through a private archive of thoughts you maybe weren’t supposed to read, but immediately recognize and relate to. I’m really excited to drop it.</p>

                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong></p>
<p>You can find me mainly on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/i_am_markoe">Instagram</a> but I also have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@i_am_markoe">TikTok</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2rXPeAmJp5uKJQ2y9Mfej5?si=uZFh_uwjQMOjhG_U5qYzTg&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=9a0746e7fe1644fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> and Apple Music as ‘Markoe’.<br><br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?<br><br></strong>I believe success is measured differently by each individual person, what seems successful to one is differently perceived to someone else. However, for myself as an artist, having a loyal fanbase, going on tour and selling out shows would really be amazing! My goal however is to be successful enough to sell out arenas and win a Grammy!</p>

<p><strong>How did you start?</strong><br><br>I started singing at 3 years old and songwriting at 7, so it has been something that has always been part of me. I released my first song postpartum after my vocal coach told me I didn’t need a label to release music which was the turning point for me starting my artist journey as I always thought you need to be signed with a label to do anything.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong><br><br>My typical day is quite different to others. I balance motherhood in the day and work on my music once the kids go to bed for the night. In between I do studio sessions and vocal lessons and a whole lot of research on how I can be better and more successful haha.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong><br><br>I actually came across my first AI artist and the music was fantastic but sadly I think if it continues then it’ll eventually take over and labels will prioritise AI artists because it’ll be less work and more money for them. It’ll kill the music industry. Personally, I think it needs to be stopped before it gets too much and harder to control.</p>

<p>My latest release is called ‘Birthday Song’ and it’s about feeling disappointment on your birthday (something I feel every year). It was 2 days before my birthday when I wrote it and it was written in a very raw moment as I just needed to get it all off of my chest. Although it’s sad, I tried to insert a message of empowerment “I prefer my own flare” so that when people listen to it and feel they can relate, they can also feel self-love and appreciation for themselves. Sometimes, we need a song we can cry to as not everyone’s birthday odds joyful and full of partying (I write for people who want to feel heard and understood).</p>

The French-English vocals are reminiscent of a diary left open at 4 a.m., an album that deals with desire, guilt, and insomnia in a minimalist, beautiful way, a kind of music that makes you remember why you listen to music in the first place, or write it at all.</p>

<p><strong>“Nuit Blanche” feels like a diary entry set to music. How much of the song came from a real sleepless night, and how much was shaped later in the studio?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, most of my songs come from sleepless nights. I recorded this one in my apartment in the middle of the night. Though it was re-written and re-arranged multiple times, the production of the track was made in the same atmosphere as the one it evokes.</span></p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4G00kv3HLRDnA7ZHjGMxWP?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>You switch between French and English in the track. What does each language allow you to express emotionally that the other doesn’t?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hook (in French) was the first part of the song that I came up with. The term “Nuit Blanche” which refers to a sleepless night literally means “white night”, which I thought had many avenues for creative exploration. As I continued writing, I realised that because I wanted the lyrics to read like a train of thought, it would flow more naturally if it read the same way I think, which is back and forth between French and English. The switch in languages is also a form of protection. Whenever I felt myself getting too vulnerable during the writing process I would switch languages so that people wouldn’t understand the next sentence (unless they’re bilingual, of course).</span></p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/Mk8qshb6/image00002.jpg" alt="image00002" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Compared to “Rotting Away In You” and “I Hate Camping,” this song feels more fragile and confessional. Was that a conscious shift in tone, or did it happen naturally?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m working on an album at the moment that loosely follows the journey that your brain goes on when you can’t sleep, therefore I want each song to represent a stage of insomnia. R.A.I.Y and I.H.C are both meant to be more lighthearted points in the record, whereas Nuit Blanche is all about overthinking in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://indiefferential.com/magazine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/4Zm2VB3r/indiefferential-magazine-11.jpg" alt="indiefferential magazine (11)" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"></a></p>
<p class="align-left"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Insomnia, guilt, desire, self-doubt,  these are very internal themes. Do you find it easier to write about your inner world than external experiences?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often use songwriting as a form of therapy, so in theory yes, however the themes in this track are heavily influenced by external experiences. Whether I’m writing about my feelings, something that happened, or something that didn’t, I always try to center the story around the feelings. That’s what reaches people. Life circumstances vary greatly, but we feel mostly the same things.</span></p>
<p class="align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/35YCYTxN/image00003.jpg" alt="image00003" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>Living in Paris as an Irish artist, how has that change in environment influenced your sound or perspective as a songwriter?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve learned so much here in Paris about music and art, as it is such a culturally rich city. I think that the blend of cultures can be heard in my music and it gives me a unique style and perspective. People in France are a lot more into music theory than other places, and that has helped me develop my composition skills. I also think there is a rural vs. metropolitan difference. Paris is so huge and busy, whereas I come from the countryside. Our ears get used to completely different things. </span></p>
<p><strong>If “Nuit Blanche” were a scene in a film, what would we see and where would the listener be sitting in that moment?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I imagine a kind of ‘Taxi Driver’ atmosphere, someone sitting on a dark street in a car. I also think it could be kind of a trippy chase scene like in ‘Requiem For A Dream’.</span></p>

                <p>The political drama that has hung over the head of TikTok for several years has finally been resolved in a way that might even give the most seasoned tech entrepreneur pause. After over a year of negotiation, legal deadlines, and congressional mandates, the social media giant has officially created a new entity, effectively allowing it to continue to do business in the States while also appeasing the security concerns that threatened to take the app off phones nationwide. This is all thanks to a new entity called "TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC."<br><br>At its heart, this is a deal between Washington’s tech wariness and the simple fact of TikTok’s size, its reach, and its profitability: this company is not going away. The company will be majority-owned by American and global investors, led by Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX—while ByteDance, its parent company based in Beijing, retains a minority position of less than 20%. This is a deal designed around a piece of federal legislation set to pass in 2024 that would have mandated a sale or banned TikTok.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6an6lqcIRe7x5IPUULpN7l?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>U.S. operations fall under the purview of a seven-member board structure with TikTok's global CEO Shou Chew still involved and TikTok veteran Adam Presser appointed as the CEO of the joint venture. "The change will ensure the safety of American users' data and compliance with the United States' cybersecurity standards without impacting the millions of people who use the app every day."<br><br>Yet behind the veneer of this “win-win” arrangement, there remains a chorus of lawmakers and critics concerned with the devil in the details. Skeptics of this arrangement include members of Congress themselves, who urge further investigation to determine if this arrangement truly cuts foreign influence or merely rebranding them with a new name. Questions also arise as to how transparent this data management will truly be with Oracle’s cloud services and retraining of its recommendation systems to address long-held security concerns. For the app's roughly 200 million users in the U.S., creators, consumers, and brands alike, nothing has changed just yet: the whirlwind of videos, dances, and micro-communities continues unimpeded.</p>

<p>But in the background, the narrative of TikTok in the U.S. now sounds like that of a startup redux rather than the current reality. Like any significant change in the tech industry, the end result of this will continue to play out in all sorts of ways, from Capitol Hill to the comments section of your favorite creator's latest upload.</p>

                <p>In early 2026, something big happened in music circles. Bandcamp, which has traditionally been seen as an oasis for independent voices and genuine artistry, announced its decision to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-announces-ban-on-ai-music/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar music created entirely or in part by artificial intelligence from its site</a>. The message is unmistakable: Bandcamp is dedicated to ensuring that musicians and listeners know their music is created by human beings, not machines.<br><br>It's this policy that differentiates Bandcamp from the majority of the prominent music streaming websites that have already begun witnessing a rise in the number of AI-generated tracks on their websites. In fact, on many prominent music streaming websites such as Spotify and Deezer, there has been a rise in the number of AI-generated tracks that have been uploaded on the website within the last year. In fact, on many such websites, the overall percentage of AI-generated tracks that have been estimated to have been uploaded on the website ranges between 18-34%. Moreover, the majority of the users have not been able to identify the difference between human-generated tracks and those that have been created using AI.<br><br>This is particularly evidenced in Bandcamp’s choice, which represents a larger cultural tension: the need for the music industry to strike a delicate balance between innovation and integrity. On the one hand, there are innovative producers such as Suno, Udio, and ElevenLabs, which have been touting the power to democratize music making and make it more accessible. These producers have been securing high-profile partnerships, large funding rounds, and touting the power of AI to collaborate with, rather than replace, musicians. For example, ElevenLabs’ recent album, titled “The Eleven Album,” includes vocal samples from both Liza Minnelli and Art Garfunkel, along with other AI-generated features.<br><br>On the other side, however, is a growing movement of artists, rights holders, and music lovers who fear that, by utilizing AI, music itself is losing its very foundation. Around the world, thousands of artists have united in opposition to unlicensed AI model training and low-quality "AI slop." In fact, some countries’ regulatory bodies have begun taking steps, as Sweden has officially removed a song created almost entirely by AI technology from its music charts, arguing that music without some level of human participation should not qualify for inclusion.<br><br>The significance of this for musicians cannot be overstated. Bandcamp's prohibition of AI isn’t the same as the rejection of technology per se. In this sense, the platform doesn’t entirely prohibit the utilization of AI, merely for small purposes such as cleaning or suggesting. However, the message it sends out to the music industry and the artists within it is quite definitive. There appears to be a section of the industry that continues to respect the craftsmanship of the individual. The music landscape itself is evolving. AI is redefining music creation, discovery, and distribution. The argument around AI and music creation will only get sharper. Some will see AI and AI-generated music as progress. Others will see AI-generated music as an attempt to commodity creativity and silence genuine human voices. The move by Bandcamp will not end this argument. Instead, it will represent a defining point where arguments around music’s future are no longer confined to boardrooms. They are now within music itself.</p>
