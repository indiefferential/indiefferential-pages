                <p><br>There is a properly oddly compelling nature to Cupid Spell's first single Look Alike. The song seems to have wandered out of the Red Room of Twin Peaks, its synths aglow like neon in mist, its vocals walking the blade's edge between knowing and terror. It's a synth-pop daydream in dark hues constructed in homage to David Lynch, but what keeps it from succeeding is the manner in which it glides so easily into his world of contradictions, where beauty and terror, lust and fear, exist in the same pale light.<br><br>Cupid Spell, the duo of Josh Kreuzman and Mandy Buffington, was formed earlier this year in Bloomington, Indiana. Josh, familiar to darkwave enthusiasts as solo artist Twice Dark, and Mandy, author and creative partner, collided with mutual fascination with love, loss, and the bizarre poetry in between. They collided on a whim, responding to a call to produce an original work for the tenth issue of Lover's Eye Press, a folio dedicated to the surrealist genius of Lynch. The result is Look Alike, a song that doesn’t simply pay homage to its inspiration but extends his world through sound, as though Badalamenti’s dreamlike chords and Julee Cruise’s spectral melodies were filtered through a new dimension.<br><br>The track opens like a mirage. A pulsing synth line shimmers in the distance, its rhythm patient and hypnotic. As it solidifies, voice-sampled from Lynch's Number of the Day series wafts in on the wind like an incantation, situating in his distinctive voice. The song wraps around it, Kreuzman and Buffington building a sound world of dark harmonies and hushed confession, sketching motifs of duality, duplicity, and the unnerving notion that we all contain two selves. A tribute and a question: if we are all mirrors, whose reflection?<br><br>The track possesses a filmic stillness. You can almost see the pan of the camera over misty pine forests or the motionless beam of a motel sign in the middle of the night. Kreuzman's synth work makes use of the creepier romanticism of Angelo Badalamenti's soundtracks, but the sound does possess a very clear modernity, contained within a minimalist beat that takes from darkwave and contemporary synth-pop equally. Buffington's is a sigh on the pillow of fantasy, distant yet anchored in a tender despair that speaks both of nowness and remoteness. They create a sound world haunted not by specters, but by remembrance and possibility.<br><br>Look Alike is remarkable not simply because of its literal visual verisimilitude but also because of its metaphysical slant. The work is not simply borrowing from Lynch's preoccupation with the double; it abides there. Its melody glides in opposing directions simultaneously, seductive and menacing, human and mechanical. There is tactileness to its sound, yet also a keening edge of division, as if the record itself were posing the question of whether it is ever possible for authenticity to exist within such an image-overloaded and copycat world.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/0tx9BjTkILWQO5zTgbnPXW?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>While the roots of Cupid Spell are in this one, there is already an air of evolution. There has been some sketching out of future content by Kreuzman and Buffington, and a string of singles as far ahead as 2025 and 2026. If Look Alike is anything to go by, then Cupid Spell is keen on creating a mood, a mood that stays long after the last note disappears.<br><br>Ultimately, Look Alike is a record scored to dream sequences. It's darkly romantic and cinematic and quietly knowing, asking listeners to linger in the threshold room between fantasy and realization. You can approach it as a David Lynch fan, a synth-pop aficionado, or just a fan of songs that can't be solved easily, but Cupid Spell is a thing of brutal beauty that makes you squirm. When the last remnants of Lynch's voice, sampled into the song, disappear into nothing, there is only one thing left to ask: when you look into the mirror of this song, who looks back?</p>

                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?<br></strong><br>Welp, ever since releasing my first album in March, I've been working to release a new song about every month or so. It's been a fun exercise in keeping the momentum and creativity going, especially since this isn't my day job, so I've got to find time (typically in the wee hours of the night) to make music. I've begun experimenting with adding more visual content with my music, which wasn't ever something I had experience doing before and it's been cool to develop that out a bit. <br> <br><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?<br></strong><br>I used to think success was to get the community at large to validate your artistry or something, but now I think that's dumb, and success to me feels like allowing yourself the space to make art and share it, regardless of how many people that reaches. Especially when you can bring your buddies along to make music together, I don't think it gets much better than that. I'll always struggle with trying to reach a larger audience to allow more of my time to spend making music, but my hope is to never let that get in the way of just making things I like with folks I like.</p>

<p> </p>
<hr>
<p> <strong>How did you start?<br></strong><br>I've always been making music on my own and with friends, and though I had ambitions to make it more legitimate, It was never my primary focus. Life never really allowed space for it properly, and I didn't have a good pathway to get there either. The biggest change that allowed me to start was having my buddy Matt provide really good input and discernment on the songs I was developing, and then meeting my audio engineer Brandon Brown. That gave me a great runway to actually put out music that I thought sounded pretty solid. <br><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?<br></strong><br>As an artist? Extremely limited. I've got a family and a job, so any time spent doing artist stuff is mostly in the cracks. Primarily at night after my kids go to bed. I'm working to carve out a tiny bit of room during the day each week to spend more time on it. So for now, most of my "artist" time is either me at my little workstation chunking away at tracks in various stages of development, or spending too much time learning how to do promotion and marketing myself (which I'm bad at and don't like doing!). But the little moments when I'm working on a song and things start coming together well and it hits you in the feels...those are the moments I hold on to and get excited about sharing with others. <br><br><strong>If your song were to be included in a movie, which one would you choose?<br></strong><br>Oh boy, I love movies. Right now, the best thing I've seen lately is 28 Years Later, it's incredibly moving in a semi-deceptive way and really speaks to our humanity and how careful we must be not to lose it, especially in the way we care for others. I know that wasn't the question, but the more I can promote how wonderful and contemplative that movie is I will! I think the latest song I released (Thoughts For The Night) would be swell for reflective moments in a nice little indie movie or something!<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?<br><br></strong>AI terrifies me. It's surreal seeing how quickly the technology is changing, and the various applications that are continually released in how AI can be utilized across the board. It will be interesting to see how things develop. I know distributors and other platforms like Spotify are doing their best in protecting AI from fully disrupting the music artist space. However, you continue to hear stories of fully AI artists gaining large following and streams, and you realize it's taking attention away from talented artists who are putting in effort to create their music. There's definitely some interesting capabilities AI can have in music and creative development, but we have to be careful with how it's applied and what it may be exploiting, especially when the technology seems to be outpacing its regulations. I'm curious and nervous to see where things go, and how creative folks are able to protect their art and still make things the public want to listen to without it being overshadowed by fully developed AI music.  <br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.<br><br></strong>My latest release "Thoughts For The Night" came out in early October, so I've been focused on promoting that. As I mentioned earlier, I'm still working to release a song about every month or so (at least till the end of the year), so I've got a few more songs I'm working on and I'll see which one shakes out the soonest to be my next release. I've also started working on alternate versions of songs I've released already which has been fun. So stay tuned for more to come...</p>

<p>German metal/post-hardcore outfit ABOUT MONSTERS return with Suffocate, their latest single under Redfield Records. A brooding and relentless track, Suffocate delves into the harrowing grip of toxic relationships—where manipulation, emotional detachment, and suffocating pressure slowly erode one’s sense of self.<br><br>Crafted by guitarist Florian Brunemann and vocalist Madeleine ‘Maddy’ Wiebe, with additional contributions from Julian Breucker (Smash Into Pieces, Future Palace, Annisokay, Beyond The Black), the single thrives on a fusion of crushing riffs, searing vocals, and an unshakable chorus. With Breucker spearheading production and Christoph Wieczorek (Annisokay, Electric Callboy, Future Palace) handling mixing and mastering, Suffocate delivers an unfiltered emotional gut punch, capturing the weight of despair and the fight for self-preservation.<br><br></p>

                <p>Super Pyramid's Grand Entrance If This Is Paradise!: Ben Rowley's Quest for Significance in Sound<br><br>Ben Rowley never did abandon hope of it. The Vancouver-born composer, songwriter, and producer for Super Pyramid literally hit the road for a bike tour of Canada before settling in Montreal to reignite his creative flame. There, among a tight-knit community of like-minded musicians, he started to write the ambitious debut album Comment if This Is Paradise!—an album that is intimate and outward-facing all at the same time.<br><br>The album, released on September 3rd, traverses wide emotional and sonic terrain. Rowley combines traditional 20th-century songcraft with fearless experimentation, challenging the listener to reside in the crossroads: joy and despair, memory and lucidity, lush strings and ice-cool electronic glow. The result is airy and detail-rich, recalling touchstones such as the psychedelic intimacy of Tame Impala, McCartney-era solo self-sufficiency, and Rufus Wainwright's baroque ornamentation.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/2RfkAy6iHKuiqThqEHqFrA?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>Many of the album's somber atmosphere are a product of the chaos that went into its making. A breakup tinged the lyrics with heartbreak and loneliness. The pandemic broke up Rowley's band arrangement, sending his collaborators to British Columbia. And in a stroke of bad fortune that borders on farce, he got a concussion after being hit by falling ice while clearing snow. Forced to work in fits and starts, he'd find himself lying across the studio couch, waiting for symptoms to abate before resuming work. "There's a quote from Louise Glück that I think is the nearest thing to attempting to say what this record is about," Rowley says. "'The fundamental experience of the writer is helplessness.' I believe helplessness is the fundamental human experience."<br><br>In spite of these difficulties, Comment if This Is Paradise! is not at all compromised. Its production is cinematic and heavy, in great measure because of the addition of Isaac Symonds of Half Moon Run, one of its most important supporting contributors whose string work and vocal processing add depth to the album's color. Rowley and Symonds constructed something epic but close, each song revealing another conception of the same basic quest for meaning.<br><br>The eclecticism of the album is present in the singles: Before &amp; After You grandly announces itself with a sweeping orchestral gesture, dissolving past and future in shimmering harmonies and misty piano; Better Angels bounds along on bounding tambourines and percussion, bringing heavy themes to life with lightness of touch; and Slow &amp; Easy eases, quietly at first, into a kaleidoscope of strings and horns, half-Lennon demo and half-Pet Sounds glory. By Never Better, with its stark introspection and tolling bells, we can see Rowley's questioning of lyrics: the quest for meaning continues, but one by one we're forced to live in doubt.<br><br>And the title—Comment if This Is Paradise!—sounds imperative, challenge, unanswerable question. Rowley does not define paradise for us; rather, he constructs a solid world in which beauty and desire and contradiction are intertwined, and he invites us to wonder in the instant.<br><br>What emerges is an album that feels both personal and universal, the sound of one artist wrestling with the unknowable while opening his inner world outward. Super Pyramid’s debut doesn’t give us certainty—it gives us wonder. And in that vast unknowing, Rowley invites us to linger, listen, and search together.<br><br>Do you want me to edit this into a concise, magazine-sized article (like the ones that I have done for Maggie Tharp or Murder Sermon), or leave it as a longer work with narrative continuity?</p>
