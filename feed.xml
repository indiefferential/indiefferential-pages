                <p><strong>Where can we find you right now and what are you up to?</strong></p>
<p>I'm currently focusing on the launch of my album. Being a self-released project, this is taking up a lot of time, but it should be worth the wait!</p>
<p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding success, I feel like any day when someone discovers (and enjoys) what I do is a day to celebrate. Not the quantity, but the quality. My goal has always been to organically grow and discover places and people through music.</p>
<p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p>
<p>I originally started in a band called Faith Healer when I was 15 years old. It's hard to believe that this was 35 years ago, but I was thown right into the deep end, so I learnt a lot from that experience. I then moved onto a few other bands before relocating to London, where I formed another group called We Were For. I also carried out various session work, which was a new experience that also helped me to further develop as an artist. I returned to Devon in 2012 and formed King Colobus with some old mates, but it always felt like a solo project with 3 other people, hence the reason why it ended up as a solo endeavour.</p>

<p><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p>
<p>My typical day as an artist is pretty sporadic...I work as a kitchen designer by day and I have a family - not terribly 'rock n' roll', so I have to find pockets of time to focus on the music. There's a lot of material that one can absorb from day-to-day life and it helps inject reality into my musical content.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding AI, I don't think any of my material could have been created with it in the round, but I can see why some people use it as a tool. Whilst none of my music has been produced with it, I did use it for some artwork...I would have had to torch a village to get the front cover of the album and for obvious reasons, this was not an option!<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p>
<p>'Torn Between Age &amp; Perseverance' is exactly what it says on the tin. Given my age, I have been dabbling with the idea of firing up the band again, but this is fraught with the challenges that life throws at all of us. It's an album about politics, religion, personal grief, insecurity and our inevitable ability to be self-distructive.</p>

                <p>Plastic Orchestra have always been a band who are not afraid of motion. The music has always been the result of joyful propulsion, changes in rhythm, and the collective sense of wonder which has a conversation rather than a statement quality. With ‘Crick in the Neck,’ the Melbourne band takes a different turn. They ease up on the rhythm, expand the emotional palette, and even introduce the notion of space into the groove. The effect is the most intimate and disclosing song they have ever done.<br><br>Ultimately, Crick in the Neck is a song about care, and the price tag that comes with it. "It’s about the sort of people who keep everyone else together," Stewart says, "who listen before they speak, who solve everyone else’s problems, who take everyone else’s stress, who keep going when everyone else wants a rest." The band’s title for the track is a masterstroke of dry wit, taking a physical ache and transforming it into an emotional shorthand that everyone recognises. Crick in the Neck is a start of a conversation, rather than a start of a fireworks display.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/1mjAkwqD3CVY4B5UqXRWy9?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>Musically, the song is a vibe rather than a push. It is a warm, relaxed beat that is funk- and R&amp;B-derived but in a way which is holistic, rather than courtesy of distinct imitation. The bass is deep in the pocket, led by the vision of leader Grace Snow, moving in a languid, eloquent way which provides the song's message. Drums are also confident in their swagger, swinging in a way which is relaxed, inviting the listener to breathe into rather than tighten up for a beat.<br><br>Guitars appear more as color than flash. The sound of them takes a nod at experimental sounds of the seventies, slightly askew and slightly playful. Guitars come in and out of focus without necessarily commanding attention but all the same managing to set mood. On this backdrop, there emerge and recede vocal harmonies of the female voice rising and falling along lines of a chant.</p>
<p><br>These voices are less lead and harmony than they are concurrent thoughts, drifting briefly around the perimeter of an idea. It is an expression of the band’s philosophy as a unit. Plastic Orchestra is a collective that exists under Snow’s banner that is fueled by their love of sound itself. They have termed it an “excuse for playing with all of the music equipment that they own,” but Crick in the Neck proves that more than can be handled is not necessarily more. There is nothing here that doesn’t feel thought-out. There is an implicit confidence in the arrangement of this song, an understanding that it doesn’t need anything more than it has in order to be understood. What sets Crick in the Neck apart from other Plastic Orchestra tracks is not simply its speed but also its emotional slowness. The group refuses to tie up any loose ends.</p>

                <p>For some years now, playlists have been touted to musicians as the promised land. Get on the right playlist, and all is well. Streams will flow. Hits will roll in. Careers flourish. Champagne is likely popping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality of it is this: your track ends up on a playlist, plays a few thousand times for people who don’t know your name, and then.poof! into the cyber ether it vanishes, leaving you where you were when you began but refreshing your stats like a maniac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not the playlists that are the problem. Playlists are great tools, sometimes astonishingly so. The end isn’t the playlists.<br><br>Somewhere along the way, artists were told that playlisting was something to be capitalized on as validation for artistry. As if the measure of success for a piece of music lay in its functionality between another piece hand.selected by an algorithm that fails to know or care who you are.<br><br><strong>And that’s when things begin to wobble.</strong><br><br>But with playlists as the goal, music itself will start to shift in shape. Songs will be shorter. Intros will be shorter. Choruses will come in sooner than is necessary. Risk will decrease. Texture will be reduced. Everything is designed to be readily pleasing, because that is what will be rewarded by the system.<br><br><strong>The payoff? Plenty of nice tunes. Very little memorable music.</strong><br><br>Ironically enough, playlists never seem to amass a devoted following. Playlists produce listeners, but not necessarily fans. Listeners will latch onto your song, give a cursory nod of the head in its regard, and then that’s it. There will be no narrative to be told, no context to provide for its meaning. You will only be a fleeting memory within their<br><br>Meanwhile, artists are spending months modifying their sound to be accepted into playlists that they will never be able to control and sometimes will never even be aware of when they are removed from them in the first place.<br><br>But there’s also a quieter cost. The pursuit of playlists causes artists to doubt their intuition. What’s being asked instead of, “Is this track authentic?” “Is it complete?” is “Will it work on Spotify?” And when that question is in the room, creativity walks out.<br><br>This, of course, doesn't mean that playlists are pointless. Playlists can serve to expose new listeners to new sounds. They can contribute to getting new releases out. And yes, they might alter a course of direction. However, they never had to be career-builders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The artists who succeed tend to think about something else, such as the establishment of a recognizable sound, storytelling in relation to the work, the performance of gigs that convert audience members to believers, or the delivery of tracks that are complete rather than optimal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In short, ultimately people will follow artists and not playlists.</span><br><br>So, absolutely, enjoy the benefit that comes with it when it arrives. Enjoy the exposure you get with it. Just don’t build a career or a body of work around something created for background listening purposes.<br><br>“Make music that would still matter if playlists didn’t exist at all.” - Andrew Lipham, music producer and songwriter That, quietly, is where the real longevity is.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most interesting musical trend for 2026, and definitely the least predictive, is not about what’s new, it’s about what’s old, and how moments from the late 2000s and early 2010s are re-emerging into the cultural consciousness, not as a retro playlist, but within unexpected viral contexts.<br><br><em>A perfect example?</em><br><br>Jon Hamm Dancing.<br><br>One of the most striking images to come out of the past few years of television is a swift-cut dance party footage from the Apple TV+ show *Your Friends &amp; Neighbors*, a drama that dates all the way back to the spring of 2025. In this recent meme sensation taken from this April release, Hamm's character, the eagerly enthusiastic Andrew “Coop” Cooper, is fully absorbed into the beat, his eyes closed in rapture. On the internet, the meme writes itself:<br><br>However, the most fascinating thing here is not the meme.<br><br>It’s the song associated with it.<br><br>On both TikTok and Facebook, the clip is typically set to 'Turn the Lights Off' by Kato featuring Jon. The song is a 2010 club hit that has a disturbingly current emotional resonance. It originated as a club tune in Europe and has wittingly or unwittingly functioned as a time machine for tired Millennials and Gen Xers—a song that evokes a pre-burnout life of late nights and much-harder-earned freedom.</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_4ucEcizRM0" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p><br><br>The surprising thing is that “Turn the Lights Off” is not even the song used in the actual series. *Your Friends and Neighbors* originally used “Sentient System” by Joseph William Morgan, a song from 2023, aptly capturing the modern feel for this series. Virality, however, affected all this. The social platforms decided on their soundtrack; this time, it captured the mood for the meme.<br><br>This is exactly how old songs are making a comeback in 2026.<br><br>Music no longer exists on a timeline. “A song could have languished for over a decade and suddenly sound even more relevant than one from last Friday.” Instead, it’s alignment and not timeline. When a song reflects a group’s emotion—exhaustion, freedom, happiness, longing—the natural process for the song to resurface occurs.<br><br>“Turn the Lights Off” is more than an anthem about club culture in this case—it’s an anthem about a lost sense of physicality. It’s about remembering when “music was something you inhabited, not something you scrolled past.”<br><br>This has profound implications for independent artists. This is further evidence that music is not a disposable medium. These back catalogs are living works that only wait for that moment to revive them. Context is as important as advertising. A TV moment, a meme, a joke shared about getting older.<br><br>As *Your Friends and Neighbours* prepares for the second season in April 2026, it is clear that the show will inevitably be forced to address the viral life after the scene. Culture has already done the legwork. "Songs won't expire come 2026." They wait. And when the opportune time comes calling, they are seen dancing their way back to relevance. The lights are switched off, but their memories are still</p>

                <p>OpenAI, the artificial intelligence giant helmed by Sam Altman, is said to be considering an acquisition of Pinterest in what would likely be the biggest acquisition to date for OpenAI, as reported by The Information in their latest scoop. Neither party has officially denied nor admitted to discussions taking place.<br><br>The prediction is published in a report called “Sutskever’s Fate, OpenAI’s Next Deal, A Hit Robot – and 13 Other Predictions for 2026” and was written by a news reporter named Ann Gehan. The report interprets the possible Pinterest deal as OpenAI’s aggressive move into e-commerce, visual discovery, and online advertising.<br><br><strong>Why Pinterest?</strong><br><br>On the face value, Pinterest appears to be a surprising candidate for a company that conducts research in AI. Nevertheless, from a strategic standpoint, it is a great fit.<br><br>It has a large set of cataloged images. This is based on the interest of the consumer – fashion, home decor, food, travel, and lifestyle. The platform is not based on the need for conversation or entertainment. This makes it a very valuable asset for AI commerce.<br><br></p>
<p>The reported focus of OpenAI’s interest is on the following three key pillars:<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>The vast visual data resource that Pinterest has<br><br></li>
<li>Its mature ad infrastructure<br><br></li>
<li>Its long-term relationships with merchants and brands<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these could greatly enhance the image/video generation capabilities of OpenAI, particularly as it increasingly faces stiff competition from Google, Meta, as well as Amazon within the AI-based e-commerce arena.<br><br><strong>Market Reacts Quickly</strong><br><br>Following the news, Pinterest shares were up 3% on Friday, as noted in Investing.com, indicating investors believe this is a real possibility. Pinterest is now worth about $17.5 billion, as shares trade at $25, close to where they were in early 2023.<br><br>It’s important to note that nearly two-thirds of voting power at Pinterest are held by co-founders Ben Silbermann and Paul Sciarra, so a takeover would necessitate collaboration between founders. Silbermann resigned as CEO around mid-2022 and left the company, but his influence still exists.<br><br><strong>Buy Rather Than Compete</strong><br><br>Conversational search, for instance, has been introduced by Pinterest using AI, making it a direct competitor against platforms such as ChatGPT. However, according to the report, there might be more value for OpenAI in acquiring rather than competing with Pinterest.<br><br>An acquisition could enable OpenAI to incorporate generative AI capabilities directly into visual search, recommendations, and advertising, turning Pinterest from a virtual mood board into a fully AI-driven discovery platform.<br><br><strong>What This Signals</strong><br><br>If the deal does come to fruition, this would represent a shift in the strategy at OpenAI, from a company that is a platform and a model supplier to one that is more of a consumer ecosystem player. Whether or not the deal ultimately takes place, the point is clear: the future battleground for AI has nothing to do with chat, and everything to do with the world of commerce, creativity, and visual discovery.</p>

                <p>By 2026, attention is the most valuable resource in the artist’s arsenal and it’s under siege. Not through a lack of opportunity, but through an endless deluge of content intended to distract, dilute, and disconnect writers from their own voice.<br><br>Here are the accounts that artists should seriously contemplate unfollowing in 2026.<br><br><strong>1. Hustle Influencers Monetizing on Anxiety</strong><br><br>"If the underlying message of an account is ’you’re already behind,’ then it's not motivation, it's manipulation."<br><br>It’s a group of people who promote productivity tips, algorithm panic, and faux urgency in order to sell courses, templates, or secrets that often have nothing to do with making artists grow creatively. Artists aren’t asked to share more content, work harder, or maximize every moment. They require clarity, patience, and time to innovate.<br><br>If following someone makes you feel guilty for resting and creating slowly, unfollow.<br><br><strong>2. Brands that Cosplay as Community</strong><br><br>In the year 2026, brands are louder than ever, but authenticity is thinner.<br><br>In many brand accounts, there is regurgitated activist speak, trend riding on cultural phenomena, and feigning interest in “supporting artists” while supplying nothing but exposure and platitudes in return. A brand that has never paid an artist, amplified actual artistic work, and has never made a meaningful commitment is not part of any sort of community; it is only marketing.<br><br>Artists need to stop following the brands that draw upon the culture without contributing to said culture in return.<br><br><strong>3. AI Slop Accounts</strong><br><br>The problem isn’t AI-written content, it’s lazy AI content.<br><br>The kinds of accounts that are churning out &amp;quot;mass-produced thought of the day&amp;quot;-type quotes, knockoff art, simulated faces, or generic notions of &amp;quot;creative inspiration&amp;quot; in the form of generated text prompts rather than personal experience are flooding the feeds.<br><br>"If an account rings hollow, or seems to be repeating itself, or lacks emotional resonance, trust your gut." Inspiration should be human.<br><br><strong>4. Comparison Traps Disguised as Advice</strong><br><br>Rather, some boasting narratives claim to educate but are filled with victories and accomplishments.<br><br>When every single post is about streams, followers, sold-out shows, or “how fast I grew,” it silently equates artistic expression with a scorecard. Artists come to determine their own worth based on another person’s timeline.<br><br>Growth doesn’t require an audience. Art doesn’t require proof.<br><br><strong>5. Trend-First, Soul-Last Creators</strong><br><br>Awareness of trends is good. Dependence on trends is fatal. Accounts that pursue every sound, every aesthetic, or every shift in platforms urge the artist to trade their identity for relevance. By 2026, the public hungers for voice, not speed. It’s the artists who no longer shape-shift that will endure. “Because if an explanation confuses you instead of clarifying your gut, let the explanation go.”</p>

        <title>The Guitar Market in 2026: Faster, Louder, and Still Utterly Bonkers</title>

                <p>There was a point when buying a guitar was a straightforward affair. You entered a store, lugged home a piece of wood, disputed with the sales assistant over whether a certain model had or hadn’t piqued the interest of a certain Eric Clapton, and went home poor but cheerful. But in 2026, the guitar market—much like the world of modern transportation—finds itself congested and besotted with the keys to innovation and thronged with offerings of which very few will own a genuine need—while the really important stuff improves quietly behind the scenes.<br><br>First of all, I'd like to talk about what's worth spending money on, what's absolutely not, and how to avoid ending up with a piece of wood that might look great on Instagram, but plays like a kitchen table.</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Age of “Cheap but Good”</strong><br><br>This is the unpleasant reality for guitar snobs: guitars for value in 2026 are ridiculously good. It’s now so player-friendly it’s almost embarrassing if you have to look at a receipt from 1997 with three thousand bucks going into a guitar.<br><br>Such brands as Squier, Epiphone, Yamaha, Harley Benton, and Cort are rolling out guitars with good fret jobs, stable necks, adequate pickup systems, and — ready for this?— setups that won’t immediately require the services of a man named Dave and his trusty soldering iron. Today, a Squier Classic Vibe Stratocaster plays so well that a consumer may be left scratching his head and wondering what the point of a "real" Fender is, if the only pleasure to be derived from the experience of playing a "real" Fender is arguing with fanboys on the net.<br><br>Harley Benton, on the other hand, is continuing its tradition of corporate sabotage with locking tuners, roasted maple neck, and stainless steel frets for the price of a decent Chinese. Glamorous? Not exactly. But annoyingly effective? Yes.<br><br>The point here is simple: if you are spending money between £300 and £600 in 2026 and buying a reputable brand, then you are not settling, you are winning.<br><br><strong>The Mid-Range Sweet Spot Nobody Talks About</strong></p>
<p><br>Finding a golf swing<br><br>Now things become more intriguing, and most level-headed folk would cease their commentary at this point. The £700-£1,200 price range in 2026 is analogous to the golden age of hot hatchbacks. It’s a period during which one gets speedy performance with little compromise and absolutely minimal buyer’s remorse.<br><br>"The PRS SE models are the poster children of this situation. They're pricey-looking guitars, easy to play, and they sound good enough to let you forget that the headstock doesn’t read ‘Custom Shop.’ The SE Custom 24 is one of the most irritatingly sensible guitars ever produced."</p>
<p>Then there’s Yamaha’s Revstar range: another triumph for understated excellence. None of this hype, just solid, beautifully crafted guitars with an air about them as if they’ve been designed by grown-ups who play the things. They are the equivalent of the Volvo estate car: rough-looking until you play one, then you just can’t get enough.<br><br>This is also where you should be looking if resale value is a concern to you. Good, recognizable lines from Fender, Gibson's Studio series, PRS SE, and Ibanez Prestige will remain worth something even if, inevitably, you find yourself saying, “Oh, I'm more of a Tele man, myself."<br><br><strong>The High-End Illusion</strong><br><br>Above £2,000, guitars become less about improvement and more about justification. Ah, yes, they're beautiful. Ah, yes, the scent of the nitrocellulose lacquer is a hint of history tinged with regret. But the law of diminishing returns bites harder than a dropped Les Paul.<br><br>A £4,000 guitar in 2026 will not be four times as good as a £1,000 one. It will be slightly better, perhaps prettier, but certainly much more stressful to possess. You'll worry about scratches. You'll have fights over cases. You'll not take it to pubs with sticky floors.<br><br>If it’s what pleases you, buy it. Happiness is a key part of this. Just don’t pretend it’s “better value.” It isn’t.<br><br><strong>The Tech Nobody Asked For (But You’ll Get Anyway)</strong><br><br>Guitar tech in 2026? Like lane-departure systems in a car: occasionally genius, mostly pesky, and mostly unnecessary. Integrated effects, app-managed tone control, Ai-aided pick-up changes? All cool, all gonna be disabled in a week.<br><br>Modeling guitars have not gone away, they're still making the demos sound amazing, but the truth is the market has quietly decided it really wants one killer sound rather than a thousand decent ones. The truth is, the real innovations in technology have been very, very boring: just better tuners, lighter hardware, more stable necks, and pickups that don’t make the sound of an angry refrigerator.<br><br><em>This is progress. Boring, glorious progress.</em><br><br><strong>What Should You Actually Buy?</strong><br><br>Buy the guitar that excites you to play. Not the one that YouTube recommended you to buy. Not the one with the most number of switches. Not the one that resembles a design made by a gaming laptop. In 2026, value for money will be good build quality, logical electronics, decent ergonomics, and a brand which will be around in ten years’ time. Spend as much money as you can, but don’t buy the level above ‘luxury,’ and remember this: tone lives in your fingers, not on price. "And if anyone tries to give you different information, you smile and wave and then go and enjoy your perfectly excellent and moderately-priced instrument – preferably while playing it very loudly."</p>

                <p>Success in the independent music world for so long had one definition and one definition alone: speed. Faster releases. Faster content. Faster growth. The songs came out to satisfy the algorithm, not the listener. The measure was attention. The end game was output.</p>

<p><br><strong>But things have changed.</strong><br><br>In 2026, independent music is quietly rejecting the notion of urgency—and in doing so, independent music is also reclaiming its intention.<br><br>This is a new trend of independent musicians choosing quality over quantity. Tracks stay on for a longer time on radios and playlists. Albums are released for a reason and are no longer a collection of singles and fillers. And the audiences, exhausted from the bombardment of music from everywhere, are appreciative of this new trend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t nostalgia. It’s recalibration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><strong>The End of “Always On” Indie Culture</strong><br><br>Artist training of the last decade boiled down to acting like a platform. Being constantly seen was a matter of staying alive. If you weren’t dropping, sharing, hinting, or engaging, then you might as well be gone.<br><br>However, the price tag was high.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is normalised. Music blurred into each other. Listeners ceased to form emotional bonds— not due to a lack of quality but due to a lack of room to breathe.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2 data-start="1550" data-end="1583">Slower Music, Deeper Listening</h2>
<p data-start="1585" data-end="1634">This shift isn’t just behavioural — it’s audible.</p>
<p data-start="1636" data-end="1671">More indie releases in 2026 favour:</p>
<ul data-start="1672" data-end="1810">
<li data-start="1672" data-end="1701">
<p data-start="1674" data-end="1701">Mid-tempo or slow grooves</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1702" data-end="1738">
<p data-start="1704" data-end="1738">Sparse, intentional arrangements</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1739" data-end="1770">
<p data-start="1741" data-end="1770">Emotionally specific lyrics</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1771" data-end="1810">
<p data-start="1773" data-end="1810">Textures that reward repeat listens</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1812" data-end="1883">These aren’t songs built for instant hooks. They’re built for presence.</p>
<p data-start="1885" data-end="1945">Music like this doesn’t compete for attention — it earns it.</p>
<p data-start="1947" data-end="1984">And crucially, listeners are staying.</p>
<p data-start="1986" data-end="2215">Longer track runtimes, full-project listens, and save rates are rising across independent platforms. The data reflects what culture already feels: people want music that meets them where they are, not music that rushes past them.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="1986" data-end="2215"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4E0P1xs3JNmsNr5c5nFTZJ?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<h2 data-start="2222" data-end="2250">Intimacy Is the New Scale</h2>
<p data-start="2252" data-end="2329">Indie success used to be measured by reach.<br data-start="2295" data-end="2298">Now it’s measured by resonance.</p>
<p data-start="2331" data-end="2543">Artists are building <strong data-start="2352" data-end="2381">smaller, deeper audiences</strong> — communities that feel invested rather than impressed. Live shows prioritise connection over spectacle. Online engagement feels conversational, not promotional.</p>
<p data-start="2545" data-end="2593">This isn’t anti-growth. It’s sustainable growth.</p>
<p data-start="2595" data-end="2637">When artists slow down, listeners lean in.</p>
<hr data-start="2639" data-end="2642">
<h2 data-start="2644" data-end="2670">Why This Moment Matters</h2>
<p data-start="2672" data-end="2725">This shift matters because it changes power dynamics.</p>
<p data-start="2727" data-end="2764">When indie music stops chasing speed:</p>
<ul data-start="2765" data-end="2849">
<li data-start="2765" data-end="2794">
<p data-start="2767" data-end="2794">Algorithms lose influence</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2795" data-end="2819">
<p data-start="2797" data-end="2819">Labels lose leverage</p>
</li>
<li data-start="2820" data-end="2849">
<p data-start="2822" data-end="2849">Artists regain authorship</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2851" data-end="2921">Music returns to its original function — expression before extraction.</p>
<p class="align-center" data-start="2851" data-end="2921"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5yKfoYiHtMr7v6A1dk5ooh?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>
<h3 data-start="3424" data-end="3467">Why Indiefferential Is Paying Attention</h3>
<p data-start="3469" data-end="3672">At Indiefferential, we’re less interested in what’s loudest<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> and more interested in what lasts. The artists shaping this slower, more intentional wave aren’t chasing relevance. They’re building meaning.</span></p>
<p data-start="3674" data-end="3720">And that’s where indie music finds its future.</p>

                <p><em>Artists, Sounds, and Signals Creating a Year of Quiet Reinvention</em><br><em>Indie Music in 2026: Slower, Deeper, and More</em><br><br>Indie music in 2026 is less about a race and more about recalibrating. There has been an algorithm-chasing, fast release, and visually overwhelming paradigm, but there’s been an evident pivot to slower tempos, emotional specificity, and emphasis on intent and purpose. There’s no real thread running through these amazing indie releases other than one that revolves around “presence,” which involves lived-in, thoughtful, and unafraid-to-be songs.<br><br>"Discovery is gradually taking place at this intersection: Where polish and authenticity come together, and artists straddle the traditional industry push and still come off as totally confident. Sites like Musosoup have become valuable trendspotters, not in what they think is hip, but in what happens. And what happens is a clear identification of an indie scene that favors vulnerable and artful over big and boisterous." </p>

<h3 data-start="1791" data-end="1873"><strong data-start="1795" data-end="1873">Plastic Orchestra — Melbourne, Australia | Alt-Indie / Experimental Groove</strong></h3>
<p data-start="1875" data-end="2356">Plastic Orchestra’s <em data-start="1895" data-end="1916">“Crick in the Neck”</em> is a study in restraint—proof that softness can still groove. Slowing things down without losing momentum, the Melbourne collective delivers a song that feels quietly radical in its empathy. Built around 70s-inspired experimental guitar textures, R&amp;B-inflected rhythms, and gently chanting vocal harmonies, the track honours the emotional labourers of everyday life—the people who hold others together while slowly wearing themselves thin.</p>
<p data-start="2358" data-end="2778">What makes Plastic Orchestra emblematic of 2026’s indie shift is their refusal to dramatise vulnerability. Instead, they let it breathe. Led by bassist Grace Snow, the project feels less like a band and more like a shared laboratory of sound—an intentional embrace of play, texture, and communal creativity. In an era where indie increasingly values feel over force, Plastic Orchestra’s music lingers long after it ends.</p>

<h3 data-start="2785" data-end="2857"><strong data-start="2789" data-end="2857">Powers of the Monk — Michigan, USA | Dream-Indie / Ambient Psych</strong></h3>
<p data-start="2859" data-end="3256">There’s a liminal quality to <em data-start="2888" data-end="2905">“Sleepy Fields”</em> that feels perfectly timed for 2026. Powers of the Monk operate in the space between waking and dreaming, where songs don’t demand attention but quietly envelop it. Reforming in 2020, the Michigan-based duo craft music that feels meditative without drifting into abstraction—anchored by gentle rhythms, warm instrumentation, and a sense of deep calm.</p>
<p data-start="3258" data-end="3611"><em data-start="3258" data-end="3275">“Sleepy Fields”</em> unfolds like an invitation rather than an escape, positioning rest itself as something intentional and luminous. In a cultural moment increasingly concerned with mental health, burnout, and sustainability, Powers of the Monk reflect a broader indie movement toward music as a grounding force—sound as sanctuary rather than stimulation.</p>
<hr data-start="3613" data-end="3616">
<h3 data-start="3618" data-end="3667"><strong data-start="3622" data-end="3667">VERONICA — London, UK | Pop / Jazz Fusion</strong></h3>
<p data-start="3669" data-end="3997">With <em data-start="3674" data-end="3692">“Ground To Dust”</em>, VERONICA exemplifies a growing class of indie artists blurring genre lines not for novelty, but for emotional precision. Recorded at London’s Meridian Studios, the track merges pop’s structural clarity with the harmonic richness of jazz, resulting in a ballad that feels both intimate and sophisticated.</p>
<p data-start="3999" data-end="4474">Born in Italy and now based in London, VERONICA’s background in classical piano and songwriting education at BIMM London surfaces subtly—not as virtuosity on display, but as control. Her sultry, nuanced vocals carry themes of dependence and vulnerability with restraint, allowing the emotional weight to unfold naturally. As indie music in 2026 leans increasingly toward nuanced storytelling, VERONICA’s work feels quietly assured, signalling longevity rather than immediacy.</p>
<hr data-start="4476" data-end="4479">
<h3 data-start="4481" data-end="4541"><strong data-start="4485" data-end="4541">Stephanie Happening — Experimental / Performance Art</strong></h3>
<p data-start="4543" data-end="4906"><em data-start="4543" data-end="4564">“Breathing Bruised”</em> resists easy categorisation—and that’s precisely the point. Framed as a “Solstice testimony,” the track functions less as a traditional song and more as a document of survival. Part of Stephanie Happening’s ongoing <em data-start="4780" data-end="4794">System Talks</em> series, it exists at the intersection of experimental sound, mental health advocacy, and collective authorship.</p>
<p data-start="4908" data-end="5320">Rather than offering resolution, <em data-start="4941" data-end="4962">“Breathing Bruised”</em> prioritises presence. Its rhythmic pulse feels deliberate, almost ritualistic, transforming lived experience into sound without sanitising it. In 2026, indie music’s boundaries continue to expand beyond entertainment alone, and Stephanie Happening stands as a powerful example of how music can function as process, protest, and healing space simultaneously.</p>

<h3 data-start="5327" data-end="5403"><strong data-start="5331" data-end="5403">Deciderata — Philadelphia, USA | Tru-Fusion / Alternative Collective</strong></h3>
<p data-start="5405" data-end="5845">Deciderata’s <em data-start="5418" data-end="5435">“Reflections:1”</em> isn’t a comeback album—it’s a recontextualisation. Reuniting after a period of inactivity, the Philadelphia collective revisits earlier material through the lens of experience, breathing new life into songs by filtering them through their distinctive Tru-Fusion ethos. Drawing from funk, screamo, nu-metal, gospel, jazz, reggae, and rock, the album feels cohesive not despite its diversity, but because of it.</p>
<p data-start="5847" data-end="6188">Led by Chris Morano’s meticulous production vision, <em data-start="5899" data-end="5916">“Reflections:1”</em> speaks to a wider 2026 indie trend: artists reassessing their own archives with renewed clarity. Rather than chasing novelty, Deciderata embrace evolution—demonstrating that indie credibility increasingly comes from continuity, collaboration, and creative self-awareness.</p>
<hr data-start="6190" data-end="6193">
<h3 data-start="6195" data-end="6271"><strong data-start="6199" data-end="6271">Born 2 B feat. Marlene Quest — London, UK | Hip-Hop / R&amp;B / Jazz-Rap</strong></h3>
<p data-start="6273" data-end="6650"><em data-start="6273" data-end="6295">“Can We Start Over?”</em> taps directly into the resurgence of emotionally driven Hip-Hop and R&amp;B, reimagining the spirit of 90s rap-and-soul duets for a contemporary audience. Built on warm keys, boom-bap rhythms, and reflective lyricism, the track centres maturity—what it means to revisit love, forgiveness, and second chances with lived experience rather than nostalgia alone.</p>
<p data-start="6652" data-end="7102">Born 2 B’s legacy within UK Hip-Hop, particularly his role in shaping the early Ninja Tune sound alongside Us3, gives the track historical weight. Marlene Quest’s soulful chorus anchors the collaboration in emotional immediacy, bridging generations of listeners. In 2026, indie increasingly values lineage and storytelling, and this release stands as a reminder that progression doesn’t require erasing the past—it requires engaging with it honestly.</p>
