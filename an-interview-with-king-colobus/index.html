Being a self-released project, this is taking up a lot of time, but it should be worth the wait!</p><p><strong>How would you define success? What is your goal?</strong></p><p>Regarding success, I feel like any day when someone discovers (and enjoys) what I do is a day to celebrate. Not the quantity, but the quality. My goal has always been to organically grow and discover places and people through music.</p><p><strong>How did you start?</strong></p><p>I originally started in a band called Faith Healer when I was 15 years old. It's hard to believe that this was 35 years ago, but I was thown right into the deep end, so I learnt a lot from that experience. I then moved onto a few other bands before relocating to London, where I formed another group called We Were For. I also carried out various session work, which was a new experience that also helped me to further develop as an artist. I returned to Devon in 2012 and formed King Colobus with some old mates, but it always felt like a solo project with 3 other people, hence the reason why it ended up as a solo endeavour.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="352" style="border-radius: 12px;" data-testid="embed-iframe" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/36x14Zy1ZW2cq6r8DsSxuK?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br><strong>What is a typical day in your life as an artist?</strong></p><p>My typical day as an artist is pretty sporadic...I work as a kitchen designer by day and I have a family - not terribly 'rock n' roll', so I have to find pockets of time to focus on the music. There's a lot of material that one can absorb from day-to-day life and it helps inject reality into my musical content.<br><br><strong>What do you think of AI in music?</strong></p><p>Regarding AI, I don't think any of my material could have been created with it in the round, but I can see why some people use it as a tool. Whilst none of my music has been produced with it, I did use it for some artwork...I would have had to torch a village to get the front cover of the album and for obvious reasons, this was not an option!<br><br><strong>Tell us about your latest or upcoming release.</strong></p><p>'Torn Between Age &amp; Perseverance' is exactly what it says on the tin. Given my age, I have been dabbling with the idea of firing up the band again, but this is fraught with the challenges that life throws at all of us. It's an album about politics, religion, personal grief, insecurity and our inevitable ability to be self-distructive.</p></div><footer class="content__inner content__footer"><div class="content__updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2026-01-12T22:06">January 12, 2026</time></div><div class="content__tag"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Tagged in:</h3><ul class="content__tag-inner"><li><a href="https://indiefferential.com/tags/introducing/" class="invert">Interviews</a></li></ul></div><div class="content__share"><h3 class="content__footer-title">Share this story:</h3><div class="content__share-inner"></div></div><div class="author"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/george-skendros-indiefferential-author.jpg" class="author__avatar" loading="lazy" alt="George S." height="1024" width="1024"><div class="author__info"><h3 class="h5 author__name"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></h3>George is a teacher, journalist, and interviewer based in Europe, with over six years of professional experience in education and cultural writing. Since 2021, he has been an active member of several editorial teams across Europe and the U.S., contributing to technology- and music-focused publications such as Indiefferential, microphone, and intheview.com. In June 2021, George joined Indiefferential Magazine, where he specializes exclusively in long-form interviews. Over the past year, he has conducted more than 2K interviews, speaking with artists, composers, designers, and athletes from around the world, often exploring the intersection of music, creativity, and personal narrative. Notable interviews include a conversation with award-winning composer Simone Benyacar, whose work spans major global campaigns such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Mission: Impossible, Call of Duty, and Assassin’s Creed; George interviewed Anna Mészöly, fresh from winning the Best Performance (Best Actress) award in the Cineasti del Presente section at the 77th Locarno Film Festival, about her collaboration with Adrien Brody in A24’s The Brutalist. He has also interviewed Edouard Boulanger, co-driver for Audi and winner of Dakar 2021, as well as British illustrator and designer Andy Bourne, whose work draws inspiration from vintage comics, pop art, and 1960s psychedelia. He holds two Master’s degrees—in Special Education and Human Geography, Spatial Development, and Planning—as well as two Bachelor-level degrees in History and Ethnology and Computer Technology. His interdisciplinary academic background informs a human-centered approach to music journalism, focusing on storytelling, creative process, and the cultural contexts surrounding sound and art. His work focuses on storytelling, creative process, and the ways music and art reflect broader social realities.</div></div><div class="content__bar contentbar" id="js-content__bar"><div class="contentbar__inner"><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="https://indiefferential.com/plastic-orchestra-ease-the-pace-and-let-the-groove-breathe-on-crick-in-the-neck/" rel="prev"><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <span>Previous</span></a></div><div class="contentbar__share"><div class="contentbar__share-inner"><h3>Share:</h3></div></div><div class="contentbar__nav"><a class="contentbar__nav-link invert" href="" rel="prev"><span>Next </span><svg height="9" width="5"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></a></div><div class="contentbar__progress" id="js-contentbar__progress" aria-hidden="true"></div></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div class="content__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6">You should also read:</h3><div class="cards content__related-cards"><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/a-conversation-with-shab/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/455/responsive/indiefferential-magazine-5-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/a-conversation-with-shab/" class="invert">A conversation with Shab</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/george-s/" class="invert" rel="author">George S.</a></div><time datetime="2025-11-18T21:10">November 18, 2025</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/an-interview-with-aevina/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/413/responsive/whats-new-3-md.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/an-interview-with-aevina/" class="invert">An interview with Ævina</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2025-10-21T22:59">October 21, 2025</time></div></div></div><div class="card__item"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/remain-blank/" class="card__image"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/380/responsive/448692402_447571941364036_5812885195031316918_n-md.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="324" width="576" alt=""></a><div class="card__content"><h3 class="card__title"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/remain-blank/" class="invert">REMAIN BLANK: Redefining Northern Grit with &quot;Plastic Hooligans&quot;</a></h3><div class="card__meta"><div class="card__author">By <a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="invert" rel="author">Indiefferential</a></div><time datetime="2024-10-01T23:24">October 1, 2024</time></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.svg" alt="Indiefferential" width="250" height="100"></a><div class="footer__copy"><p>© Indiefferential 2026</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Indiefferential" aria-label="Facebook" class="facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div></div></footer><div class="newsletter-popup" data-show-on-scroll="800px" data-show-after-time="5000ms"><div class="newsletter-popup__inner"><div class="newsletter-popup__right"><button class="btn white newsletter-popup__close">&times;</button><h3>Subscribe</h3><p>Get the latest news, updates and more delivered directly to your email inbox</p><input class="newsletter-popup__submit" type="submit" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" value="Subscribe"></div></div></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
