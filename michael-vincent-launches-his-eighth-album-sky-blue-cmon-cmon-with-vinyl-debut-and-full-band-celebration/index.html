The album arrives November 7, 2025, and continues Vincent's tradition of pairing sharp indie rock edges with tender, folk-inflected melodic storytelling.<br><br>Vincent, with a seven-album back catalog, has managed to carve out a niche for himself in the Bay Area music scene that is raw, warm, and always full of heart. SKY BLUE (C'MON, C'MON!) leans into that legacy with a colorful mix of indie, power pop, garage-rock grit, and softer tracks that nod to his folk-rock roots. It's an album that reaches out while staying true to the emotional directness and songwriting honesty that have gained him listeners across the world.<br><br>The album both opens and closes with its namesake track, “C’mon, C’mon!”—two versions that act like bookends to the record’s sonic journey. The first bursts open with amplified swagger and punch, influenced by the likes of The Dandy Warhols. The closing version shifts the tone, warmer and more open-armed, inviting rather than shouting. Both versions were crafted in collaboration with Charles Normal, the acclaimed indie artist and brother of late rock icon Larry Norman—one of Vincent’s earliest heroes. The two worked between Norway and California, trading ideas and arrangements that sparked the song’s dual identity.</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="352" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2DWaJCKAhBdiO8twIVvrY9?utm_source=generator" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><br>Vincent describes the song's explosive start as "grabbing you by the shirt and hauling you away," setting the pace for the record that follows.<br><br>To celebrate the release, Michael Vincent &amp; U No Who will play all ten tracks live at the San Gregorio General Store on November 8. The band—Scott Warren, guitar; Dave Mendoza, bass and vocals; Anthony Fulgar, percussion—brings a richly varied backdrop of influences running from New Order and The Strokes to Fruit Bats, Snow Patrol and even Latin jazz legends Malo and Azteca.<br><br>Vincent's previous album, Electric Fox, garnered international attention and peaked at #2 on the US Roots Music Report in July 2023. His musical pedigree extends through a history of collaborating with several notable acts, including recording with Mark Karan (The Other Ones, RatDog, Phil Lesh and Friends) and sharing a bill with Jeff Pehrson and Ruth Gerson.<br><br>Sky Blue feels like a natural chapter in a long, evolving story: one that invites new listeners in and rewards longtime followers with the fire, craft, and intimacy they've come to love. A spin of vinyl, a road-tripping anthem, a celebration of rock's never-ending heartbeat: C'mon, C'mon.</p><p class="align-center"> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__share-tag-wrap"><div class="content__share"><h3 class="h6">Share this:</h3></div></div><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/website/indiefferential.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1024" width="1024" alt="Indiefferential"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="inverse" title="Indiefferential">Indiefferential</a></h3>Indiefferential team<p><a href="https://indiefferential.com/authors/indiefferential/" class="btn">View all posts</a></p></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev"><a href="https://indiefferential.com/whats-new-november-editions/" class="content__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/449/responsive/indiefferential-magazine-2-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""><div class="content__nav__text">Previous Post<h3 class="h5">What&#x27;s New November Editions</h3></div></a></div></nav><div class="content__related"><h3 class="h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/giant-killers-revisit-indie-pop-glory-with-new-single-around-the-blocks/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/368/responsive/whats-new-28-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/giant-killers-revisit-indie-pop-glory-with-new-single-around-the-blocks/" class="inverse">Giant Killers Revisit Indie - Pop Glory with New Single ‘Around the Blocks’</a></h4><time datetime="2024-08-31T17:48">August 31, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/andrew-levin-interview/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/365/responsive/whats-new-26-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/andrew-levin-interview/" class="inverse">A conversation with Andrew Levin</a></h4><time datetime="2024-08-10T03:54">August 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://indiefferential.com/a-conversation-with-megan-conner/"><img src="https://indiefferential.com/media/posts/356/responsive/whats-new-16-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="576" width="1024" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4><a href="https://indiefferential.com/a-conversation-with-megan-conner/" class="inverse">A conversation with Megan Conner</a></h4><time datetime="2024-07-22T12:09">July 22, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/indiefferential"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7Gwd5X8/indiefferential-members.png" alt="indiefferential-members" border="0"></a></div></main><footer class="footer"><a class="logo" href="https://indiefferential.com/">Indiefferential</a><nav class="footer__nav"><ul></ul></nav><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/indiefferential/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://indiefferential.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Indiefferential 2025</div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth:'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar',};</script><script defer="defer" src="https://indiefferential.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b103b2211e74472ffa1a0d35c0918ecc"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
